It
is
also
interesting
philosophically,
and
highlights
issues
with
common
ideas
regarding
`falsification'
(this
footnote
is
EXTREMELY
tangential).
\par
`Falsification'
is
often
defined
as
a
property
a
theory
has
if
(and
only
if)
there
exist
a
set
of
observations
that
would
rule
the
theory
out.
Good
scientific
practice
is
then
often
defined
as
making
theories
falsifiable
and
not
being
dogmatic
when
theories
are
falsified.
\par
A
common
objection
to
this
(and
one
I
agree
with)
is
that
this
criterion
is
too
simplistic
to
vindicate
what
we
think
of
as
good
scientific
practice.
\par
The
core
of
the
objection
is
the
idea
of
\href
{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_holism}{confirmation
holism}.
Theories
can
never
make
predictions
on
their
own,
but
must
be
supplanted
with
auxilliary
hypotheses.
For
example,
such
auxilliary
hypotheses
could
be
the
buondary
conditions
of
the
governing
equations
(like
the
details
of
the
orography)
or
that
even
the
observational
instruments
are
working
as
intended.
\par
In
this
case,
the
`theory'
(that
there
is
a
deep
northward
flowing
boundary
current)
generated
the
`prediction'
that
a
neutrally
buoyant
float
should
drift
northward,
but
this
prediction
was
only
generated
with
the
auxilliary
hypothesis
that
the
eddy
transport
would
be
negiligible!
\par
This
auxilliary
hypothesis
turned
out
to
be
wrong,
but
the
observations
confirmed
the
theory
by
luck!
If,
instead,
we
hadn't
been
so
lucky
and
the
float
flowed
southward,
then
we
probably
\par
would
it
be
irrational
or
`unscientific'
to
not
immediately
abandon
the
theory
that
there
should
be
a
deep
western
boundary
current?
