# C5-Notes

These are set of latex notes based off the notes I took for the C5: Physics of Atmospheres and Oceans course. You can access the course in the 'main.pdf' file.

These are free to use, however, they are unfinished, so please do not distribute these freely online!

All references to figures or information from other books are (hopefully) under fair use. If there are any copyright issues, please do not sue me I cannot afford it. Instead just contact me and I'll try and fix or remove it!
