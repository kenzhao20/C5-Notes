# C5-Notes

These are set of latex notes based off the notes I took for the C5: Physics of Atmospheres and Oceans course. You can access the course in the 'main.pdf' file.

These are free to use, however, they are unfinished, so please do not distribute these too freely! I'd rather you refer back to this resource just in case I've made updates. All errors, typos, syntactic or semantic mistakes are mine and mine only, so please contact me if you spot any of these and I will fix them!

All references to figures or information from other books are under fair use. If there are any copyright issues, please do not sue me I cannot afford it. Instead just contact me and I'll try and fix or remove it!
