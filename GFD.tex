\section*{Introduction}

This section of the course was lectured by \href{https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/woollings}{Tim Woollings}, covering Basic and Advanced Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD). Basic GFD is covered in HT, while Advanced GFD is covered in Trinity term.\vspace{5 mm}

\noindent This section consists of six chapters. Basic GFD covers the first four chapters, and Advanced GFD covers the last two:\vspace{5 mm}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \hyperref[Prelim GFD]{Preliminaries}: 
        
        \begin{quote}
            This chapter covers some preliminaries worth knowing prior to . This includes a reminder on Vector Calculus \hyperref[VC box]{Definitions} and \hyperref[VC Interp]{Interpretations}, Fluid Mechanics, and brief discussions on differential heating and the effects of stratification and rotation.
        \end{quote} 

    \item \hyperref[EoM GFD]{The Equations of Motion}: 
    
        \begin{quote}
            To be perfectly honest, you could skip almost all of this section except for the final coloured box should you wish. Here we introduce the primitive equations of motion governing the fluid mechanics of the atmospheres and oceans. We main aim of this chapter is to derive a final simplified set of equations.
        \end{quote}
    
    \item \hyperref[Dia Relations]{The Fundamental Diagnostic Relations}:
        
        \begin{quote}
            We introduce some fundamental diagnostic (time-independent) relations, including hydrostatic balance and geostrophic balance, then discuss the implications on (anti-) cyclones and Thermal Wind Balance. We use hydrostatic balance to transform explicitly into pressure coordinates, and express the prior relations in terms of pressure coordinates.

            Even though such relations are diagnostic (i.e., they feature no time-derivatives), these relations might still hold even if the system is changing: in this case, the relations may hold in a quasi-steady manner (a concept introduced in Part \ref{Climate Dynamics}).
        \end{quote}
    
    \item \hyperref[Shallow Water System]{The Shallow Water System}:
        
        \begin{quote}
            We finally analyse a simple time-dependent system. In doing so, we sacrifice the vertical dimension (i.e., dispense of the vertical coordinate $z$) and work solely in a 2D system. We use this sytem to introduce energy in GFD, including KE (Kinetic Energy) and APE (Available Potential energy), as well as Potential Vorticity. 
            
            Finally, we show that the (linearised) Shallow Water Systems allows certain wave solutions, including Poincaré, Rossby, and Kelvin Waves, which redistribute energy in the Atmosphere and Oceans.
        \end{quote}
    
    \item \hyperref[3D Systems]{3D Systems}:
        
        \begin{quote}
            We reintroduce the vertical coordinate $z$ and analyse 3D time-dependent responses in GFD. After a briefly disussing 3D Gravity Waves (the analogue to the Shallow Water Poincaré waves), we derive and interpret Quasi-Geostrophic Theory.
            
            We then analyse Rossby Waves through this framework, then give a very cursory introduction to Instability and Geostrophic Turbulence.
        \end{quote}

    \item \hyperref[Oceans]{Ocean Circulation}:
        
        \begin{quote}
            The final section in GFD focuses exclusively on the Oceans, although some concepts may be applicable to the atmosphere. 
            
            We first introduce Ekman Transport, and analyse analyse its implications, which include up/downwelling of fluid and Sverdrup Balance, the implication of both Ekman up/downwelling and conservation of potential vorticity.
            
            Finally, we briefly discuss the Meridional Overturning Circulation, and introduce two simple models which aim to capture the dynamics: the Stommel and Gnanadesikan Box Models.

\section{A Quick Reminder on Vector Calculus}

Before we jump into \textbf{Geophysical Fluid Dynamics} (\textbf{GFD}) proper, we start with a quick reminder of some vector calculus concepts. I'll mainly focus on the interpretation of these concepts, as this will be important for the interpretation of physical results later on.

You should be familiar with all the information in the box below:

\begin{fact}{Vector Calculus Definitions}{VC box}\label{VC box}
    Let $\vec{r}=(x,y,z)^T$ denote the position vector and $t$ denote the time.\vspace{3mm}

    \begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth}
        We write the \textbf{partial derivative} with respect to coordinate $x$ as follows (the subscripts indicate which variables are held constant while differentiating; in this case, coordinates $y, \, z,\, t$ are held constant while differentiating with respect to $x$):
        \begin{align}\label{partial}
            \partial_{x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}=\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right)_{y,\,z,\,t}
        \end{align}
        Often we will omit the large brackets and leave implicit which coordinates are being held constant. Analogous for $y$, $z$, $t$.
    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth}
        We define the \textbf{nabla} operator $\vec{\nabla}$ as follows (in Cartesian coordinates):
        \begin{align}
            \vec{\nabla}&=\left( \begin{array}{c}
                \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\\\\
                \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\\\\
                \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
            \end{array} \right)
            \\
            &=\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \right)^T \nonumber
        \end{align}
    \end{minipage}

    \vspace{3mm}Let $p(\vec{r},t)$ be an arbitrary scalar field and $\vec{u}(\vec{r},t)=(u_x,u_y,u_z)^T$ be an arbitrary vector field.

    We define the \textbf{Gradient}, \textbf{Curl}, and \textbf{Divergence} as follows:

    \begin{minipage}{.44\linewidth}
        \begin{align}
            \BOX{\text{Grad}\,\, p \equiv \vec{\nabla}p=\left( \begin{array}{c}
                \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\\\\
                \frac{\partial p}{\partial y}\\\\
                \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}\\
            \end{array} \right)}
        \end{align}
    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}{.54\linewidth}
        \begin{align}
            \BOX{\text{Curl}\,\, \vec{u} \equiv \vec{\nabla}\times \vec{u}=\left( \begin{array}{c}
                \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial z}\\\\
                \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial z}-\frac{\partial u_z}{\partial x}\\\\
                \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}\\
            \end{array} \right)}
        \end{align}
    \end{minipage}

    \begin{align}
            \BOX{\text{Div}\,\, \vec{u} \equiv \vec{\nabla}\cdot \vec{u}= \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z}}
    \end{align}


\end{fact}

In this box we mentioned a \textbf{scalar field} and a \textbf{vector field}. A field is just anything that has a value at each point in space and time. A \textbf{scalar field} is a field that takes a scalar value at each point. For example, the pressure field $p=p(\vec{r},t)$ is a scalar field, which denotes the pressure at each point in space and time. Meanwhile, a \textbf{vector field} is a field that takes a vector value at each point. The velocity field $\vec{u}=\vec{u}(\vec{r},t)$ is a vector field, which denotes the velocity at each point in space and time. While this isn't strictly correct, you can just think of a vector field as three scalar fields stacked on top of each other (one for each component).

Now we will interpret the \textbf{Gradient}, the \textbf{Curl}, and the \textbf{Divergence}.

\subsection{The Gradient}

We can only take the gradient of a \textbf{scalar field}, and the gradient is always a \textbf{vector field}.

The gradient encodes the local change properties of the \textbf{scalar field} with respect to space. More specifically, at each point in space and time, the value of the gradient is a vector with the following properties: the direction (in 3D space) of the vector is in the direction of steepest ascent, and the magnitude of the vector denotes how much the scalar field ascends at that point.

You should be familiar with the one-dimensional Taylor expansions. Consider some function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$\footnote{This is fancy speak for the function $f(x)$ takes real numbers as an input and outputs real numbers.}. The following is the Taylor expansion of $f$, which holds for small $\delta x$:
\begin{align*}
    f(x+\delta x)=f(x)+\frac{df}{dx}\delta x
\end{align*}
An analogous version holds in three dimensions as well:
\begin{align*}
    p(\vec{r}+\delta\vec{r},t)&=p(\vec{r},t)+\left( \vec{\nabla}p(\vec{r},t) \right)\cdot \delta\vec{r}\\
    &=p(\vec{r},t)+\left( \text{Grad }p(\vec{r},t) \right)\cdot \delta\vec{r}
\end{align*}

Consider the case where $\delta \vec{r}$ is perpendicular to $\vec{\nabla}p$ (i.e., $\vec{\nabla}p\cdot \delta \vec{r}=0$). In this direction, there is no local change in $p$, therefore $p(\vec{r}+\delta\vec{r},t)=p(\vec{r},t)$ for all $\delta\vec{r}\perp \vec{\nabla}p$. This implies that contours of constant $p$ are \textbf{always} perpendicular to the gradient of $p$. 

\subsection{The Curl}

We can only take the curl of a \textbf{vector field}, and the curl is always a \textbf{vector field}.

Broadly, the curl measures the local rotation of the \textbf{vector field}. More specifically, at each point in space and time, the value of the curl is a vector with the following properties: the direction (in 3D space) of the vector is in the direction perpendicular to the plain of rotation (following the right-hand rule)\footnote{This is just a convention. The right hand rule means that if you form a thumbs up with your right hand, your thumb is parallel with the curl if and only if the rotation is in the direction from your knuckles to the end of your fingers (following your fingers).}, and the magnitude of the vector denotes how much local rotation there is at this point.

Note crucially that this only measures the \textbf{local} rotation, not the global rotation. The example often given to explain this distinction is a paddleboard: consider a very small paddleboard suspended in a fluid with a velocity field $\vec{u}(\vec{r})$. The paddleboard is pushed around by the flow. The curl of $\vec{u}$ encodes whether the paddleboard itself will turn, not whether it will follow a circular path.

\end{figure}

\subsection{The Divergence}

We can only take the divergence of a \textbf{vector field}, and the divergence is always a \textbf{scalar field}.

Broadly, the divergence measures the local `spreading out' properties of a \textbf{vector field}. More specifically, at each point in space and time, the value of the divergence is a scalar that is larger the more 

I find the divergence theorem explains divergence the easiest:
\begin{align}
    \label{Div Thm}
    \iiint_v \vec{\nabla}\cdot \vec{u} \,dV \equiv \iint_s \vec{u}\cdot d\vec{S}
\end{align}
where $v$ and $s$ denote that we integrate over the volume and surface, respectively, of some closed 3D blob (closed means there are no holes on the blob). Suppose that $\vec{u}$ is some flux per unit area. If, for example, $\vec{u}$ is the velocity, then $\vec{u}$ would be the volume flux per unit area. 

The divergence theorem says that the \textit{total flux} out of some blob (equal to the integral of $\vec{u}$ over the surface of the blob, i.e., the right-hand side of \ref{Div Thm}) is equal to the \textit{total divergence} of the blob (equal to the integral of $\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{u}$ over the volume of the blob, i.e., the left-hand side of \ref{Div Thm}). 

The divergence can therefore be thought of as the outwards flux of $\vec{u}$ at some point, i.e., as encoding how many vectors point towards or away from a point. If the divergence is positive/negative, more/less arrows point outward than inward at that point (respectively). If the divergence is $0$, then exactly the same `amount' of arrows point inwards as outwards. 

As a summary:
\begin{fact}{Vector Calculus Interpretation}{VC Interp}\label{VC Interp}
    \begin{minipage}{.39\linewidth}
    \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=myyellow!50!white,colframe=mymagenta]
        \begin{align*}
            \vec{\nabla}p
        \end{align*}

        The \textbf{Gradient} $\vec{\nabla}p$ is a vector field which encodes how the scalar field $p$ varies with space.

        $\vec{\nabla}p$ always points towards the direction of steepest ascent in $p$, and is perpendicular to contours of constant $p$.

        \begin{align*}
            \vec{\nabla}\times \vec{u}
        \end{align*}

        The \textbf{Curl} $\vec{\nabla}\times \vec{u}$ is a vector field which encodes the local rotation properties of the vector field $\vec{u}$.

        The curl does \textit{not} encode the large-scale rotation properties of $\vec{u}$.

        \end{align*}

        The \textbf{Divergence} $\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{u}$ is a scalar field which encodes the local `spreading out' properties of the vector field $\vec{u}$.

\end{fact}

\section{A Quick Reminder of Fluid Mechanics}

To aid understanding, we quickly introduce some concepts of fluid mechanics. Tim should have a more comprehensive review on canvas should you need it.

First we introduce the concept of a fluid element. This is an infinitesimal volume of fluid, whose properties may change as it is advected around with the flow. For example, in deriving the \hyperref[Dry Adiabat]{Dry Adiabat}, we were considering a fluid element of air – except we called it an `air parcel' then.

Second, we introduce the \hyperref[Material Derivative]{Material Derivative}:
\begin{align}
    \frac{D}{Dt}=\underbrace{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}}_{\text{Time Derivative at a Fixed Point}}+\underbrace{\vec{u}\cdot\vec{\nabla}}_{\text{Advection}}
    \label{Material Derivative}
\end{align}
The \hyperref[Material Derivative]{Material Derivative} of a quantity is the time-derivative of a quantity \textit{following a fluid element}. This is useful because it is much easier to consider what effects might change a quantity of a fluid element. For example, the forces per unit mass $\vec{F}$ affect a fluid parcel as follows: $\frac{D\vec{u}}{Dt}=\vec{F}$ (this is just Newton's second law).

However, in GFD, we will mostly be interested in how a quantity changes at a \textbf{fixed point in space} $\left(\text{indicated by the } \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \text{ term}\right)$, \textit{not following a fluid element}. If we rearrange the Equation \ref{Material Derivative} for $\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \right)$, we find that the quantity at some point is modified by both whatever affects the fluid element $\left( \frac{D}{D t} \right)$, for example the force $\vec{F}$, and the properties of fluid elements which are advected into that location $-\vec{u}\cdot\vec{\nabla}$:
\begin{align}\label{MatDerivTerms}
    \underbrace{\frac{\partial A}{\partial t}}_{\text{Local change in }A}=
    \underbrace{\frac{DA}{Dt}}_{{\text{Change in }A \text{ following a fluid element}}}-
    \underbrace{\vec{u}\cdot\vec{\nabla}A}_{\text{Advection of fluid elements with different }A}
\end{align}

Hopefully you can see why this physically makes sense. The local change in $A$ is the is comprised of the the change in $A$ following a fluid element, i.e., comprised of what happens exactly at that point, \textbf{and} advection, i.e., the effect of fluid elements that low into that point. Advection is the negative dot product of $\vec{u}$ with the gradient of $A$. Hopefully this makes sense too: the gradient points in the direction of increasing $A$. If $A$ is increasing in the same direction as $\vec{u}$, then $\vec{u}$ is `blowing' areas of lower $A$ into areas of higher $A$, so this should be a negative contribution to the local change in $A$.

Third, we introduce the idea of \hyperref[Material Conservation]{Material Conservation}. You might have heard about what it means for a quantity to be \textbf{conserved}. For example, if you've solved a mechanics problem, you might recall that the total energy was conserved, meaning that $\frac{dE}{dt}=0$ where $E=$ the total energy.

\hyperref[Material Conservation]{Material Conservation} is a closely related idea, where certain quantities are conserved following a fluid parcel. Mathematically, a quantity $A$ is materially conserved if and only if it obeys the following relation:
\begin{align}\label{Material Conservation}
    \frac{D A}{Dt }=0
\end{align}
In other words, if one follows a fluid parcel, that quantity does not change. However, as a whole, $A$, need not be globally conserved. If one considers Equation \ref{MatDerivTerms} and sets $\frac{D A}{Dt }=0$, then you can see that the only local change in $A$ is from fluid parcels with different $A$ being advected into that location.

Exercise: refer forwards to Equation \ref{Energy Equation}. Note even if we assume that $Q=0$, we will find that $\frac{DT}{Dt}\neq 0$. In other words, temperature is not materially conserved (so long as $\beta\neq0$). This is why we introduced the idea of \hyperref[Potential Temperature]{Potential Temperature}, as it is the case that $\frac{D\theta}{Dt}=0$ (excercise: take \ref{Energy Equation}, solve for $\beta$ using the ideal gas law, set $Q=0$, and show that $\frac{D\theta}{Dt}=0$ using the product rule).

Finally, we define the vorticity $\vec{\omega}$ as the curl of the velocity:
\begin{align}
    \vec{\omega}=\vec{\nabla}\times\vec{u}
\end{align}
If you refer back to the box on \hyperref[VC Interp]{Vector Calculus Interpretation}, this should remind you that the curl of the velocity is the \textbf{local} rotation of the velocity field, not the \textbf{global} rotation. We will usually be considering the vertical component of the vorticity $[\vec{\omega}]_z$, which we will often write just as $\xi$.

\section{Why There Is Motion in the First Place}\label{Differential Heating}

It's important to consider why there is motion in Atmospheres and Ocean in the first place.

Regarding the first point, if you are familiar with the \hyperref[Navier Stokes]{Navier Stokes Equations} governing fluid flow, then you will know that $\vec{u}=\vec{\nabla}p=0$ is a solution, and is a solution a system will tend towards if there is friction and forcing\footnote{This forcing can be encoded in the boundary conditions, for example.}, and planets certainly have friction. We therefore need a non-uniform energy source. In this case, it is the Sun, and it drives motion because it provides energy to the Earth unevenly. On small scales, this may be because of variations in reflectivity (albedo), but on large scales this is mostly due to the spherical geometry of the Earth: more solar radiation is absorbed at the equator than at the poles (think: \textbf{zenith angle} from \hyperref[Radiative Transfer]{Radiative Transfer}, which goes as $\cos\zeta$).

This differential heating causes horizontal temperature gradients, which in turn cause horizontal density and pressure gradients, which drive motion. Another way to think of it is as follows: in equilibrium, the Earth absorbs more solar radiation in the equator than in the poles (see Figure \ref{Diff Heating}). As such, there must be an energy transport mechanism from the equator to the poles, and this is what drives fluid motion.\footnote{
    I'm personally somewhat ambivalent about this explanation, but I'm not very confident so be sceptical of what I'm about to say. Here's why I'm uncomfortable about this explanation: I cannot see why it must be the case that the variation in OLR cannot be identical to the variation in absorbed solar radiation. To put it another way, I cannot see why the dotted curve cannot be identical to the solid curve in Figure \ref{Diff Heating}. It feels like putting the cart before the horse: surely the fluid dynamics also itself affects the OLR into space.

    I prefer the following explanation. Assume that differential heating did not obtain, and that the poles and equator were in perfect equilibrium, such that the absorbed solar at each point exaclty equalled the OLR. Because the absorbed solar is more at the equator than the poles, that means the OLR must be more at the equator than the poles. Loosely following the properties of emission (recall  \hyperref[Emission Box]{this information on emission}) suggests that the poles must be colder than the poles. 

    This implies that there must be horizontal temperature gradients, and where there are temperature gradients there are density gradients. These horizontal density gradients generate instability, because a system with the minimum amount of gravitational potential energy will only have \textit{vertical} density gradients: hence motion.

\section{What is Special About `Geophysical' Fluid Mechanics?}\label{GFD Special}

It is also important to consider what sets \textbf{Geophysical Fluid Dynamics} apart from most other Fluid Dynamics. There are two important properties that \textbf{Geophysical Fluid Dynamics} aim to investigate: \textbf{stratification} and \textbf{rotation}. The effects of these will pop up again and again throughout \hyperref[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics]{GFD}.

\subsection{Stratification}

\textbf{Stratification} is important because the fluids in the atmospheres and oceans are affected by gravity and vary in density. 

You have already seen the effect of stratification when we derived the \hyperref[Hydrostatic Balance]{Hydrostatic Balance}. We found that pressure decreases with height 
\begin{align*}
    \frac{dp}{dz}=-\rho g\\
    \frac{d}{dz}\left( \rho R T \right)=-\rho g\\
    RT \frac{d \rho}{dz} + \frac{}{}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Rotation}

\textbf{Rotation} is important because, generally, planets rotate, and the equations of motion ensure that fluid parcels must obey conservation of angular momentum. The idea is as follows: if a fluid parcel is at rest relative to the surface of the Earth, its total angular momentum will actually differ depending on where it is. If it is at the poles, it will have no angular momentum, whereas if it is at the equator, it will have a large amount of angular momentum.

In the previous section, we discussed how differential heating implies that there must be some motion. This motion is required to close the energy budget. Becuase there both is net radiative heating at the equator and net radiative cooling at the poles, and the equator and poles are not heating and cooling over time, there must be some mechanism transfering energy from the equator to the poles. This is achieved by the atmospheres and oceans.

Let us then consider a extremely simple model of this: \textbf{Hadley's Model} of convection as a zonally (zonally means east-west) symmetric equator-to-pole convection cell:
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw (0,0) -- (5,0) arc[start angle=0, end angle=90, radius=5cm] -- cycle;
        %\draw (5,0) -- (0,0) -- (0,5);
        \draw (0,0) -- (3,0) arc[start angle=0, end angle=90, radius=3cm] -- cycle;
        %\draw (3,0) -- (0,0) -- (0,3);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Convection Cell: [FIGURE UNDER CONSTRUCTION]}
\end{figure}

Let us not consider a fluid parcel in this convection cell. We assume that this fluid parcel starts out at the equator at rest (relative to the surface of the Earth) and moves north. We also assume that there are no zonal forces (i.e., no east-west forces) acting on the fluid parcel. This is a highly unrealistic assumption. We further assume that the radius of the Earth $a$ is much larger than the height of the fluid parcel above the Earth.

We know that the total angular momentum of the parcel is approximately equal to the following:
\begin{align*}
    L(\phi,u) = \underbrace{a\cos\phi}_{\vec{r}} \underbrace{\left( \Omega a \cos \phi + u \right)}_{\vec{u}}
\end{align*}
where $a=$ the radius of the Earth, $\phi=$ the latitude, $\Omega=$ the angular velocity of the Earth, and $u=$ the zonal velocity of the fluid parcel relative to the surface of the Earth. The angular momentum is equal to $\vec{r}\times\vec{u}$, the radius $\vec{r}$ times the velocity $\vec{u}$. The radius is equal to $a\cos\phi$ (as it is the radius from the axis of rotation), and the velocity is equal to $\Omega a \cos \phi + u$, the sum of the velocity from the rotation of the Earth and the velocity relative to the Earth.\footnote{
    This is, strictly speaking, incorrect. The angular momentum is a vector (actually a pseudo-vector), so it’s strange to say that the angular momentum is equal to a scalar value. To be more precise, $L(\phi,u)$ is the component of the angular momentum in the direction aligned with the angular velocity of the Earth. In other words parallel the vector pointing directly upwards from the ground at the north pole.
}

Since there are no zonal forces on the air parcel, this implies that the angular momentum is conserved. Setting $L(\phi,u)=const$ imposes the constraint $u=u(\phi)$. We use our assumption that, at $\phi=0$ (the equator), the $u=0$ (fluid parcel is at rest). Therefore, some simple algebra gives us the following relation:
\begin{align*}
    \boxed{u=a\Omega \left( \frac{1}{\cos\phi}-\cos\phi
    \right)}
\end{align*}

Essentially, what this says is that, as the air parcel moves north (as $\phi$ increases), the zonal velocity $u$ also increases! Conservation of angular velocity imposes that the air parcel is deflected as it moves northwards, so fluid parcel motion cannot always be as straightforward on a rotating planet as on a non-rotating planet.

Of course, this model is highly unrealistic. Firstly, it predicts that $u\to\infty$ at $\cos\phi\to\pi/2$, which is clearly unphysical. Secondly, from observations, we pretty much never observe $u\geq\qty{150}{\metre\per\second}$, so the model fails much earlier than $u\to\infty$. In reality, our assumption that there were no zonal forces was a very inaccurate assumption: as horizontal velocities become arbitrarily large, these induce large shears (a shear is when a layer of stuff (e.g., air) is sliding over another layer of stuff (e.g., air)), which in turn induce large forces either from viscous or turbulent eddy stresses.\footnote{For a cursory look at the effect of vertical stresses, refer to this section on \hyperref[Ekman Transport]{Ekman Transport}!}

However, the general moral of the story does apply: there are conservation laws that constrain motion more on rotating planets than non-rotating planets. We find that this will actually be the Material Conservation of Potential Vorticity, but this is jumping ahead a bit.

Looking back, this should be seen as as cursory, highly unrealistic taste of the effect that stratification and rotation might have on dynamics. It won't be much of an exaggeration ot say that we'll spend most of GFD discussing the effects of rotation.

\chapter{The Equations of Motion}\label{EoM GFD}

\section{The Primitive Equations of Motion}

For simplicity we ignore state variables like salinity, humidity, etc., and restrict our attention to a system fully characterised by 6-state variables: the velocity $\vec{u}=(u,v,w)$, pressure $p$, density $\rho$, and temperature $T$. These are governed by six equations: 3 momentum budget equations (\ref{Navier Stokes}), one mass budget equation (\ref{Mass Conservation}), one energy budget equation (\ref{Energy Equation}), and an equation of state (\ref{EoS}). Each term is labelled below:
\begin{gather}
    \boxed{\underbrace{\frac{D\vec{u}}{Dt}}_{\text{Acceleration and Advection}}
    =\overbrace{-\frac{1}{\rho}\vec{\nabla}p}^\text{Pressure Gradients}\underbrace{-g\vec{k}}_\text{Gravity}+\overbrace{\nu\vec{\nabla}^2\vec{u}}^\text{Viscous Dissipation}\underbrace{+\frac{\nu}{3}\vec{\nabla}(\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{u})}_\text{}+\overbrace{\vec{F}}^\text{Other Forces}}
    \label{Navier Stokes}
    \\
    \boxed{\underbrace{\frac{D\rho}{Dt}}_\text{Change in Mass of Fluid Parcel}
    +
    \overbrace{\rho\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{u}}^\text{Convergence/Divergence of Mass}=0}
    \label{Mass Conservation}
    \\
    \boxed{\underbrace{c_p\frac{DT}{Dt}}_\text{Energy of Air Parcel}-\overbrace{\frac{\beta T}{\rho}\frac{Dp}{Dt}}^\text{Heating by Compression}=\underbrace{Q}_\text{Diabatic Heating (e.g., by radiation)}}
    \label{Energy Equation}
    \\
    \boxed{\rho=\underbrace{\rho(T,p,\ldots)}_{\text{Equation of State}}}
    \label{EoS}
\end{gather}

\noindent where $\frac{D}{Dt}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+\vec{u}\cdot\vec{\nabla}$ is the material derivative; $g=$ gravitational acceleration; $\vec{k}=$ unit vector towards the centre of the Earth; $\nu=$ kinematic viscocity; $\vec{F}=$ other forces per unit mass (e.g., friction); $c_p=$ heat capacity per unit mass; $\beta=-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial T}$ thermal expansion coefficient; and $Q=$ heating per unit mass.

However, the equations currently are not fit for purpose. First, these equations are written for a coordinate system that is \textit{inertial} (non-accelerating) and \textit{cartesian}. However, the surface of the Earth is curved and the Earth is rotating\footnote{or so NASA and the lizard overlords would have you think!}, and we wish to describe what is going on \textit{here} with us. Furthermore, it would be quite demanding (computationally and conceptually) to adopt an inertial non-curved coordinate system, as then you'd have to, for example, keep track of the fact that the mountains keep moving. 

Second, these equations are currently too complicated to be analytically tractable. We will make various approximations later to simplify the equations of motion, however we should note that many of the terms we neglect cannot be neglected in a weather forecast or climate model.

\section{Simplifications}

\subsection{Rotating Coordinate Systems}

As already mentioned, the momentum budget equation applies for an \textit{inertial coordinate system}, i.e., a coordinate system which is not accelerating. However we wish to describe the dynamics in a rotating coordinate system which rotates with the Earth (or planet). Our goal now is to  find a relation between the time derivative of some arbitrary vector $\vec{A}$ in an inertial coordinate system $\left(\frac{d\vec{A}}{dt}\right)_I$ and the time derivative in a rotating coordinate system $\left(\frac{d\vec{A}}{dt}\right)$.

We consider two coordinate systems: an \textit{inertial} coordinate system and a \textit{rotating} coordinate system. Both systems share an origin, but the \textit{inertial} coordinate system rotates with a constant angular velocity $\vec{\Omega}$ where $|\vec{\Omega}|$ is the angular speed (in \qty{}{\radian\per\second}) and $\vec{\Omega}$ points along the axis of rotation.

Now consider some arbitrary vector $\vec{A}(t)$ in or rotating coordinate system. The time derivative in the inertial coordinate system $\left(\frac{d\vec{A}}{dt}\right)_I$ is related to the time derivative in the rotating coordinate system $\left(\frac{d\vec{A}}{dt}\right)_R$ as follows (see Figure \ref{Inertial to Rotating}):

        \label{Inertial}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{The change in $\vec{A}$ in a rotating (\ref{Rotating}) and inertial (\ref{Inertial}) coordinate system. As seen in \ref{Inertial}, the change in the inertial coordinate system $\delta t \left( \frac{\partial \vec{A}}{\partial t} \right)_I$ (thick arrow) is equal to sum of the change in the rotating coordinate system $\left( \delta t \left( \frac{\partial \vec{A}}{\partial t} \right)_R \right)$ \textit{and} the rotation of the rotating coordinate system $\left(\delta t\,\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{A} \right)$ (thick dashed arrows).}
    \label{Inertial to Rotating}
\end{figure}
\begin{align}
    \left(\frac{d\vec{A}}{dt}\right)_I=\left(\frac{d\vec{A}}{dt}\right)_R+\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{A}
    \label{Rotating Relation}
\end{align}

If we let $\vec{A}=\vec{r}$, where $\vec{r}$ is the position of our fluid parcel, we can apply Equation \ref{Rotating Relation} twice to obtain an expression for the acceleration of a fluid parcel in a rotating coordinate system.
\begin{align*}
    \vec{u}_I &= \left( \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \right)_I\\
    &= \left( \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \right)_R+\vec{\Omega}\times \vec{r}\\
    \vec{u}_I & = \vec{u}_R+\vec{\Omega}\times \vec{r}\\
    \therefore \vec{a}_I & =
    \left( \frac{d\vec{u}_I}{dt} \right)_I\\
    &= \left( \frac{d\vec{u}_I}{dt} \right)_R+\vec{\Omega}\times \vec{u}_I\\
    &= \left( \frac{d\vec{u}_R}{dt} \right)_R
    +\vec{\Omega}\times\left( \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \right)_R
    +\vec{\Omega}\times\left( 
        \vec{u}_R+\vec{\Omega}\times \vec{r}
     \right)\\
    &=\vec{a}_R+2\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{u}_R+\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{r}
\end{align*}

Therefore the acceleration in the rotating frame of reference $\vec{a}$ is equal to the acceleration in a inertial coordinate system summed with two fictitious\href{https://xkcd.com/123/}{$^*$}  forces: the \textbf{centrifugal force} and the \textbf{coriolis force}.
\begin{align}
    \vec{a}_R=\vec{a}_I+\underbrace{2\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{u}_R}_\text{Coriolis}
    +\underbrace{\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{r}}_\text{Centrifugal}
\end{align}

The \textbf{centrifugal force} is the force that pushes objects away from the axis of rotation. This is the force that makes your arms fling out if you spin. The \textbf{coriolis force} is the force that diverts moving objects which move away or towards the axis of rotation. 

We have thus transformed Equation \ref{Navier Stokes} into a rotating coordinate system:
\begin{align}
    \frac{D\vec{u}}{Dt}+2\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{u}+\frac{1}{\rho}\vec{\nabla}p+g\vec{k}=-\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{r}+\nu\vec{\nabla}^2\vec{u}+\frac{\nu}{3}\vec{\nabla}(\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{u})+\vec{F}\label{Navier Stokes Rotating}
\end{align}

\subsection{Local Cartesian Coordinates}

We have just learnt how to deal with coordinate systems that vary with time. We will now skim over (since the details aren't that interesting) how to deal with coordinate systems that vary with space.

We wish to use a coordinate system that follows the surface of the Earth, with the basis vectors $\hat{x}$, $\hat{y}$, $\hat{z}$, pointing in the east, north, and upwards (away from the centre of the Earth) directions. In this coordinate system, we define the position and velocity coordiates $(x,y,z)$ and $(u,v,w)$ as indicating distance and velocity in the east, north, and upwards directions, respectively. We further define the latitude $\phi\in[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]$ ($\phi=0$ indicates the equator, $\phi=\pm\frac{\pi}{2}$ is the north/south pole) and the radial distance $r$ where $r=a+z$ where $a=$ the radius of the Earth (see Figure \ref{LocCartes}).

Churning through the algebra, we get:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{Du}{Dt}-\left( 2\Omega+\frac{u}{r\cos\phi} \right)\left( v\sin\phi-w\cos\phi \right)+\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}
    =F_x\\
    \frac{Dv}{Dt}+\frac{wv}{r}+\left( 2\Omega+\frac{u}{r\cos\phi} \right)u\sin\phi+\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}=F_y\\
    \frac{Dw}{Dt}-\frac{u^2+v^2}{r}-2\Omega u \cos\phi+\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}+g=F_z
\end{align*}
where we have lumped together all the terms on the right-hand-side of \ref{Navier Stokes Rotating} into the $F_x, F_y, F_z$. Many of the extra terms $\left( \text{e.g., the } \frac{wv}{r} \text{ term}\right)$, are due to the fact that we have adopted a local cartesian system, in which the coordinate system changes as we move over the Earth. 

\subsection{Incompressibility}

Our final assumption is regarding the compressibility of fluids. If a fluid has constant density ($\rho=\rho_0=const$), then by Equation \ref{Mass Conservation} $\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{u}=0$ applies. We say that this fluid is \textbf{incompressible}: every bit of fluid that enters some volume must also leave.

We will end up assuming that $\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{u}=0$. Note that this should seem, to you, a \textbf{highly} dubious assumption. First, we know that sound waves are possible (after all we can hear, both on land and in water), but sound waves are impossible in an incompressible fluid. Second, and more importantly, we know that the atmosphere is approximately an ideal gas, which can have its density changed if warmed or cooled. For the ocean, we know that temperature, salinity, and pressure all change the density of seawater.

However, we are justified to use this equation if we assume that density variations $\delta p = \delta p (x,y,z,t)$ are much smaller than the background density $\rho_0$.
\begin{align}
    \therefore \boxed{\vec{\nabla}\cdot \vec{u}=0}\label{Incompressible}
\end{align}

However, I should emphasise that this does \textit{not} allow us to assume that $\frac{D\rho}{Dt} = \frac{D\delta \rho}{Dt} = 0$ applies.

\subsection{Scale Analysis}\label{Scale Analysis}

Finally, we make a few phenomenological simplifications. We do this here for simplicity, but our results are not general or particularily robust: these terms are essential in climate/weather models. We do this here by performing a \textbf{scale analysis}: we estimate the size of quantities by their typical values (found empirically), then ignore terms that are much smaller than the other terms. We never neglect the pressure gradient term. \vspace{5mm}

I do not write out all the details here, as they would easily take multiple pages. If you are curious about the details, refer to the mini-scale analysis I do in deriving \ref{Hydrostatic GFD}. A more rigorous method would be non-dimensionalisation, but this is overkill for our purposes. Again, if you are curious about the details, refer to the mini-non-dimensionalisation I do in deriving the \hyperref[Rossby Number]{Rossby Number}. 

Suffice it to say that we eliminate many terms through this scale analysis. This includes any terms that feature the viscosity $\nu$ and many terms arising from our local cartesian coordinate system. The centrifugal force is \textit{not} eliminated universally by our scale analysis, but we neglect this term for a different reason.\footnote{The reason is that we can rewrite the centrifugal force is a conservative force, i.e., we can write it as the gradient of a scalar field: i.e., there exists a $\Phi$ such that $-\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{r}=-\vec{\nabla}\Phi$. After this, we can simply subsume this into our gravitational potential.}

After eliminating the small terms, we arrive at our final simplified set of equations. 

\section{The Simplified Equations of Motion}

\begin{fact}{The Simplified Equations of Motion for GFD}{Eqns for GFD Box}\label{Eqns for GFD Box}
    We define the horizontal gradient operator as $\vec{\nabla}_h=\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x},\frac{\partial}{\partial x},0 \right)^T$, the horizontal velocity as $\vec{u}_h=\left( u,v,0 \right)^T$, the horizontal forces as $\vec{F}_h$, and the \textbf{coriolis parameter} as $f=2\Omega\sin\phi$ where $\phi=$ the latitude.

    The simplified equations of motion we will be using are as follows: \vspace{2mm}

Physically, the \textbf{coriolis parameter} $f=2\Omega \sin \phi$ is the planetary vorticity: it is the vorticity that a fluid parcel at rest (relative to the surface of the Earth) has in the $z$-direction. Note that we've ignored the Energy Equation (\ref{Energy Equation}). This equation is important, and it is used to derive an approximate mass conservation equation later in section , but the details are slightly convoluted and we don't really discuss it in C5.

We will mostly be dealing with the horizontal momentum equation \ref{Horizontal Approximate}, so it is worth detailing the interpretation of each terms. The first term, $\frac{D\vec{u}_h}{Dt}$ is the material derivative of $\vec{u}_h$. It represents the acceleration and advection of $\vec{u}_h$. The $f\vec{k}\times\vec{u}_h$ term is the acceleration due to coriolis. The $\frac{1}{\rho}\vec{\nabla}_h p$ is the force due to the horizontal pressure gradient. Finally, the $\vec{F}_h$ term is external forces, e.g., friction, wind-forcing, etc.

\section{Hydrostatic Balance (Approximate Vertical Momentum Balance)}\label{App Vert Bal}

We now make further approximations to extract physical intuition. Consider \ref{Vertical Approximate}, and again perform a scale analysis and assume that $F_z\approx 0$.
\begin{align*}
    &&\frac{Dw}{Dt} &+
    & \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}+
    &g=0
    \\
    &\underbrace{\frac{\partial w}{\partial t}}_{\frac{W}{T}}+ 
    &\underbrace{u\frac{\partial w}{\partial x} 
    + v\frac{\partial w}{\partial y}}_{U\frac{W}{L}}+ 
    &\underbrace{w\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}}_{W\frac{W}{H}}+ 
    &\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}+
    &g=0
    \\
    &\sim\frac{W}{T}+
    &\sim U\frac{W}{L}+
    &\sim\frac{W^2}{H}+ 
    &\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}+
    &g=0
    \\
    \therefore
    &\frac{\text{\qty{e-2}{\metre\per\second}}}{\text{\qty{e5}{\second}}}+ 
    &\text{\qty{10}{\metre\per\second}}\frac{\text{\qty{e-2}{\metre\per\second}}}{\text{\qty{e6}{\metre}}}+ 
    &\frac{\left( \text{\qty{e-2}{\metre\per\second}} \right)^2}{\text{\qty{e4}{\metre}}}+ 
    &\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}+
    &\text{\qty{10}{\metre\per\second\squared}}=0
    \\
    &\text{\qty{e-7}{\metre\per\second\squared}}+
    &\text{\qty{e-7}{\metre\per\second\squared}}+
    &\text{\qty{e-8}{\metre\per\second\squared}}+
    &\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}+
    &\text{\qty{10}{\metre\per\second\squared}}=0
    \\
    &\bcancel{\text{\qty{e-7}{\metre\per\second\squared}}}+
    &\bcancel{\text{\qty{e-7}{\metre\per\second\squared}}}+
    &\bcancel{\text{\qty{e-8}{\metre\per\second\squared}}}+
    &\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}+
    &\text{\qty{10}{\metre\per\second\squared}}=0
\end{align*}

As seen then, many of the acceleration terms (the terms in the $\frac{Dw}{Dt}$) are 8 orders of magnitutde smaller than gravity! As such, the only term that can balance the gravity term is the pressure gradient. We thus neglect all other terms and derive again:

\begin{fact}{Hydrostatic Balance}{Hydrostatic GFD Box}\label{Hydrostatic GFD Box}
Hydrostatic Balance governs the vertical pressure variation in a fluid if we assume that vertical acceleration (and advection) is small.
    \begin{equation}\label{Hydrostatic GFD}
    \BOX{
        \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}=-\rho g
    }
    \end{equation}
Pressure decreases with height in order to balance the force of gravity.
\end{fact}

Physically, hydrostatic balance is a force/momentum balance in the vertical direction, where the force of gravity is balanced by the vertical pressure gradient. Notice now the difference between the Hydrostatic Balance I have written here (\ref{Hydrostatic GFD}) and the Hydrostatic Balance I have written in the \hyperref[Thermodynamics]{Thermodynamics} Section (\ref{Hydrostatic Balance}): I have written it here with a partial derivative. Strictly, it should have been a partial derivative before too, but I write it here to note that we are now considering horizontal variations as well as vertical variations.

For an ideal gas, one can substitute for $\rho$ using \ref{Ideal Gas}:
\begin{align}\label{Hydrostatic Ideal Gas}
    \boxed{\frac{\partial \ln p}{\partial z}=-\frac{g}{RT}}
\end{align}

\section{Geostrophic Balance (Approximate Horizontal Momentum Balance)}\label{App Horiz Bal}

\subsection{Rossby Number and Non-Dimensionalisation}

Let us now consider the horizontal momentum equation \ref{Horizontal Approximate} and let $\vec{F}_h\approx 0$ for now. We nondimensionalise the equations by defining dimensionless hatted variables and choosing characteristic scales such that the dimensionless hatted variables are of order 1:
\begin{align*}
    t=[t]\hat{t}\text{   ;   }
    \vec{r}=L\vec{\hat{r}}\text{   ;   }
    \vec{u}_h=[u_h]\vec{\hat{u}}_h\text{   ;   }
    p=[p]\hat{p}
\end{align*}

So, for example, $[t]= $ the timescale with dimensions of time and $L= $ the lengthscale with dimesions of length, while $\hat{t}$ and $\vec{hat{r}}$is the dimensionless time/position variables. We \textit{must} pick these scales $[t]$, $L$, $[u_h]$, $[p]$ \textit{such that} the hatted variables ($\hat{t}$,$\vec{\hat{r}}$, $\vec{\hat{u}}_h$, $\hat{p}$) are of order one, so we're constrained by the system under consideration.\footnote{
    In fact we've already made an implicit assumption that the system is roughly isotropic, which means that we can choose $[v]=[u]=[u_h]$ and $[x]=[y]=L$.  
} We now substitute these variables into \ref{Horizontal Approximate}:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{[u_h]}{[t]}\frac{\partial\vec{\hat{u}}_h}{\partial t}+\frac{[u_h]^2}{L}\left( \vec{\hat{u}}_h\cdot\vec{\hat{\nabla}} \right)\vec{\hat{u}}_h+[u_h]f\vec{k}\times\vec{\hat{u}}_h+[p]\frac{1}{\rho}\vec{\nabla}_h\hat{p}=0
\end{align*}
where $\vec{\hat{\nabla}}=(\partial/\partial \hat{x},\partial/\partial \hat{y})^T$ is the non-dimesional nabla operator. Dividing by $f[u_h]$, we get:
\begin{align*}
    \underbrace{\boxed{\frac{1}{f[t]}}}_{\equiv St}\frac{\partial\vec{\hat{u}}_h}{\partial t}+\underbrace{\boxed{\frac{[u_h]}{fL}}}_{\equiv Ro}\left( \vec{\hat{u}}_h\cdot\vec{\hat{\nabla}} \right)\vec{\hat{u}}_h+\vec{k}\times\vec{\hat{u}}_h+\underbrace{\boxed{\frac{[p]}{\rho f [u_h]}}}_{\equiv P}\vec{\nabla}_h\hat{p}=0
\end{align*}

We thus see three non-dimesional coefficients appear in front of each of the terms in each equation: $St$, $Ro$, and $P$.\footnote{
    While $St$ and $Ro$ are standard nomenclature for these non-dimesional quantities, $P$ is not.
} These non-dimesional coefficients compare the relative size and therefore importance each term in the Horizontal Momentum equation. You might expect there to be four non-dimesional coefficients because there were four scales we could choose, but there are only three because this fourth non-dimensional coefficient is set by the Horizontal Momentum equation itself: all the terms on the left hand side \textit{must} sum to $0$.

Now, written just in terms of the non-dimensional coefficients, we write the (isotropic) non-dimensional horizontal momentum equation:
\begin{align}
    \label{Horizontal Approximate nondim}
    \underbrace{St\,\frac{\partial\vec{\hat{u}}_h}{\partial t}}_{O(St)}+
    \underbrace{Ro\,\left( \vec{\hat{u}}_h\cdot\vec{\hat{\nabla}} \right)\vec{\hat{u}}_h}_{O(Ro)}+
    \underbrace{\vec{k}\times\vec{\hat{u}}_h}_{O(1)}+
    \underbrace{P\,\vec{\nabla}_h\hat{p}}_{O(P)}=0
\end{align}

Note that because we have nondimensionalised such that each variable is of order one, the $\vec{k}\times\vec{\hat{u}}_h$ is always of order one, while the other terms are of order $St$, $Ro$, and $P$, respectively.

The physical interpretation of each coefficient is as follows: $St$ represents the ratio of the intrinsic timescale of the system $[t]$ (set by dynamics of the particular problem under consideration) and the timescale of the rotation of the planet $1/f$. This intrinsic timescale could be set, for example, by the stratification (for example the Brunt Vasalla frequency you encountered in Clouds PUT REFERENCE HERE $[t]=1/N$). Other times, if there is no intrinsic timescale, the timescale is often set by the advection $[t]=L/[u_h]$. If this timescale is much shorter than the rotation timescale (i.e., if $[t]\ll 1/f$) then $St\gg 1$, so the left-hand most term is much larger than the rotation $\vec{k}\times\vec{\hat{u}}_h$ term. Physically, this means that the local rate of change `doesn't see' the fact that the planet is rotating. This is because everything happens so quickly that the planet hasn't rotated much to affect events. This is what happens on human scales: if I throw a ball at you then this takes much less time than $1/f\sim$ 1 day, so we don't notice the Earth rotating.

For simplicity, we simply assume at this point that the following obtains: that the timescale is set by advection or something slower than advection such that $[t]\geq L/[u_h]$ (i.e., we are never interested in stuff happening on very time-scales shorter than the advective timescale). As such, we can approximate $St\leq Ro$ so that we get:
\begin{align*}
    Ro\,\left( \frac{\partial\vec{\hat{u}}_h}{\partial t}+\left( \vec{\hat{u}}_h\cdot\vec{\hat{\nabla}} \right)\vec{\hat{u}}_h\right)+\vec{k}\times\vec{\hat{u}}_h +P\,\vec{\nabla}_h\hat{p}=0
\end{align*}

We can now explain the \textbf{Rossby Number} $Ro$ very easily. $Ro$ compares the effect of advection/acceleration to rotation: if $Ro \ll 1$ (the \textbf{Rossby Number} is small), then rotation is important and dominates dynamics. If $Ro \gg 1$ (the \textbf{Rossby Number} is large), then the flow evolves in such a way where coriolis is negligible.

\begin{fact}{Rossby Number}{Rossby box}\label{Rossby Box}
    We define the dimensionless \textbf{Rossby Number} $Ro$, which encodes the relative importance of (planetary) rotation and advection/acceleration terms, as follows:
    \begin{gather}
        \label{Rossby Number}
        \BOX{
            Ro=\frac{U}{fL}
        }
    \end{gather}
    where $U=$ the horizontal velocity scale, $f=$ the coriolis parameter, and $L=$ the horizontal length scale.
    
    If $Ro\ll 1$, then the rotation of the planet is important, and the flow should be approximately \textbf{Geostrophic}. If $Ro\gg 1$, then acceleration/advection is important.
\end{fact}

Note that I have not specified $P$. This is because we expect the pressure scale $P$ to be set by the dynamics governed by the \hyperref[Horizontal Approximate]{Horizontal Momentum Equation}. If $Ro\ll 1$, then we expect $P$ to be of order $1$ in order to balance the coriolis $\vec{k}\times\vec{\hat{u}}_h$ term. If $Ro\gg 1$, then we expect $P$ to be of order $Ro$ in order to balance the advection/acceleration $D\vec{\hat{u}}_h/Dt$ term. 

We can also write the Rossby Number in terms of a ratio between the planetary vorticity and relative vorticity. The planetary vorticity $\omega_{planetary}$ is the angular velocity of a fluid parcel due to the rotation of the Earth, and scales as $f$. The relative vorticity is the vorticity of our fluid parcel in our coordinate system which is rotating with the Earth, and scales as $\omega_{relative}\sim[\vec{\omega}]_z=[\vec{\nabla}\times\vec{u}_h]_z\sim U/L$. Therefore:
\begin{align}
    Ro &= \frac{\omega_{relative}}{\omega_{planetary}}\\
    &\sim\frac{U/L}{f}
\end{align}

The actual size of $Ro$ depends on the kind of system we are considering: i.e., what are the length-scales and velocity-scales of the system. But it also, crucially, depends on the coriolis parameter $f=2\Omega\sin\phi$. $f=0$ at or near the equator, and so it is unlikely that $Ro$ will ever be small near the equator. However, this does not imply that rotation is unimportant near the equator, but it does imply that the flow is probably not geostrophic near the equator.

Much of what we will discuss here in GFD will require $Ro$ to be small and for the system to be geostrophic, or approximately geostrophic. This means that what we discuss is really only guaranteed to be accurate in the mid-/high-latitudes (coincidentally where we are!). It is worth bearing this in mind. However, note that $Ro$ being small is a \textit{sufficient} condition (provided of our assumptions are not bad either) – it is not a \textit{necessary} condition. $Ro$ being large does not imply that our theories must fail.

\subsection{Geostrophic Balance}

If $Ro\ll 1$ and all other forces are negligible, then rotation dominates dynamics. We can therefore neglect external forces (set $\vec{F}_h\approx0$) and acceleration and advection (set $D\vec{u}_h/Dt\approx0$) in Equation \ref{Horizontal Approximate nondim} (the horizontal momentum equation). Because the equation must equal $0$, we are forced to conclude that $P$ is of order one, so Equation \ref{Horizontal Approximate nondim} and therefore Equation \ref{Horizontal Approximate} must be a balance between the horizontal pressure gradient force and the coriolis force.\footnote{
    You might be suspicious from what I've said. After all, $Ro$ depends on velocity-scale $U$ and length-scale $L$, which we expect should be set by the dynamics and governed by the underlying equations of motion!

    In other words, \textit{if} $Ro\ll 1$, then we expect the system to be in geostrophic balance, but why is $Ro\ll 1$ in the first place, and why would our atmosphere/ocean system tend towards a state such that $Ro\ll 1$ holds?

    The answer lies in the phenomenon of \textbf{geostrophic adjustment}, which you can read about in Vallis' textbook on GFD \cite{Vallis}. The gist is this: anomalies and instabilities on a rotating planet cannot simply propagate away (e.g., via gravity flattening the surface of a fluid, for example) from the source to make the fluid more homogenous. It cannot because the fluid is on a rotating planet, and so must preserve some form of angular momentum.

    As such, after anomalies begin propagating away, there will come a point (where it reaches the anomaly reaches the \hyperref[SW Def Radius Box]{Rossby Deformation Scale}) where it is deflected by the coriolis force, and the system evolves \textit{towards} geostrophic balance.

    More details, again, can be found in Vallis' book.
} 

\begin{fact}{Geostrophic Balance}{Geostrophic Box}\label{Geostrophic Box}
    A flow is geostrophic if the dominant terms in the horizontal momentum balance equation (Equation \ref{Horizontal Approximate}) are the coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. As such, these terms must balance as follows:
    \begin{align}
        \label{Geo Bal}
        \BOX{f\vec{k}\times\vec{u}_h=-\frac{1}{\rho}\vec{\nabla}_hp}
    \end{align}
    This results in a velocity field determined by the pressure gradient as follows (Exercise: Show that Equation \ref{Geostrophic Balance} satisfies Equation \ref{Geo Bal} for any arbitrary pressure field $p$):
    \begin{align}\label{Geostrophic Balance}
        \boxed{\vec{u}_h=\frac{1}{\rho f}\vec{k}\times\vec{\nabla}_hp}
    \end{align}
\end{fact}

Written out, each component of $\vec{u}_h=(u,v)^T$ is as follows:

\begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        \BOX{u = -\frac{1}{\rho f}\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}}
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        \BOX{v = \frac{1}{\rho f}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}}
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}

\vspace{2 mm} Recall that the horizontal gradient of pressure $\vec{\nabla}_h p$ points in the direction of increasing $p$. Equation \ref{Geo Bal} shows that the coriolis force, which pushes a fluid at right angles to its velocity, balances the pressure gradient force, which pushes a fluid from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure.

We can use Equation \ref{Ideal Gas} to show that, for an ideal gas, geostrophic balance may be written as follows:
\begin{align}
    \label{Geostrophic Ideal Gas}
    \vec{u}_h=\frac{RT}{ f}\vec{k}\times\vec{\nabla}_h\ln p
\end{align}

\subsection{Cyclones and Anti-Cyclones}\label{Cyclones}

The horizontal velocity field is thus set by the horizontal pressure field in Equation \ref{Geostrophic Balance}. 

Recall from our \hyperref[VC Interp]{Vector Calculus Interpretation Box} that the contours of constant $p$ are always perpendicular to the gradient $\vec{\nabla}_h p$ of the pressure field $p$, and point from areas of low pressure to areas of high pressure. Recall further that a cross product of two vectors $\vec{a}\times\vec{b}$ is always perpendicular to both $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$.\footnote{
    The way I like to remember how this works is the right-hand rule. Make a cartesian coordinate system with your right hand: first make a thumbs up with your right hand, then point your index finger away from you, then point your middle fingle to your left.

    Now consider $\vec{a}\times\vec{b}=\vec{c}$. If you align $\vec{a}$ with your thumb, then align $\vec{b}$ with your index finger, then $\vec{c}$ will be pointing in the direction of your middle finger!

    Further note: (I think?) this is why we call certain cartesian coordinate systems a right handed coordinate system, because $\hat{x}\times\hat{y}=\hat{z}$, where $\hat{x}$, $\hat{y}$, $\hat{z}$ are the unit vectors pointing in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions.
}

Therefore, if the flow is geostrophic, then $\vec{u}_h$ flows parallel \textbf{isobars} (an isobar is defined as a contour of constant $p$). It is not difficult to verify this by showing that $\vec{u}_h\cdot\vec{\nabla}_h p=0$.

If you consider blobs of higher or lower pressure (which I will draw with circles for simplicity), you will see that the horizontal velocity flows either clockwise or anticlockwise around the areas of high or low pressure. Whether it is clockwise or anticlockwise will depend if we are in the northern hemisphere (so that $f=2\Omega\sin\phi>0$ obtains) or in the southern hemisphere (so that $f=2\Omega\sin\phi<0$ obtains).

Now, of course, cyclones and anti-cyclones as I have described them here are theoretical approximations to \textit{actual} cyclones and anti-cyclones. One way in which actual cyclones/anti-cyclones differ is that they are subject to other forces, like friction with the ground or centrifugal forces. Another way in which actual cyclones/anti-cyclones differ is that they are three-dimensional, and we have not considered the vertical velocity in cyclones or anti-cyclones.

However, we do not yet have the vocabulary needed to fully describe such systems. We will have to postpone discussion regarding this for now.

Suffice it to say that cyclones and anti-cyclones are weather systems that propogate across the mid-/high-latitudes. They can be generated if there is energy to cause an area of high or low pressure, and they dissipate due to the effects of surface friction and potential vorticity (a concept we will cover later). Because of how cyclones and anti-cyclones interact with the ground and friction, cyclones result in areas of rising air, while anti-cyclones result in areas of sinking air. Thinking back to convection, this brings unsettled, cloudy, and rainy conditions in the former case.

\subsection{Gradient-Wind Balance}

We will now make a brief detour to analyse how the centrifugal force affects cyclones and anti-cyclones. 

I should be clear \textit{which} centrifugal force we are considering in this subsection. In this case, we are considering the the centrifugal force on the air parcel arising from the fact that the air parcel is moving in a circle \textit{around the centre of the cyclone or anti-cyclone}, and is therefore accelerating inwards towards the cyclone. This gives rise to a centrifugal force that pushes the air parcel away from the centre of the cyclone (in the frame of reference rotating with the cyclone/anti-cyclone).

We are \textit{not} considering the centrifugal force on the air parcel arising from the fact that air parcel is moving in a circle \textit{around the centre of the Earth} (due to the fact that the Earth is spinning), and is therefore accelerating inwards towards the centre of the Earth. This gives rise to a centrifugal force that pushes the air parcel away from the centre of the Earth (in the frame of reference rotating with the Earth but not the cyclone/anti-cyclone). 

Now that we've gotten this potential confusion out the way, consider an air parcel moving in circular motion around a centre of high or low pressure. We adopt a local polar coordinate system, with the coordinates $(r,\theta)$ where $x=r\cos\theta$ and $y=r\sin\theta$. We assume there are no forces in the $\theta$-direction and only consider forces in the $r$-direction.

In this direction, there are three forces on the air parcel. We already considered the first two: the pressure gradient force $\left( -\frac{1}{\rho}\vec{\nabla}_h p = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} \hat{r} \right)$ and the coriolis force $\left( f\vec{k}\times \vec{u}_h = fu_h\hat{r}  \right)$ where $u_h=|\vec{u}_h|$ and $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing in the $r$-direction. Since the air parcel is moving in circular motion, we know that it is subject to a centrifugal force away from the vortex with magnitude $\frac{u_h^2}{r}\hat{r}$.\footnote{Equivalently, we can say that the parcel must be accelerating inwards with an acceleration of $-\frac{u_h^2}{r}\hat{r}$}. For an cyclone and an anti-cyclone in the northern hemisphere, it will look as follows:

\end{figure}

Notice how, for a cyclone, the centrifugal force points in the same direction as the coriolis force. For an anti-cyclone, the centrifugal force points in the opposite driection as the coriolis force (i.e., in the direction of the pressure gradient force).

Therefore, if the pressure gradient force is of a similar size for both a cyclone and anti-cyclone, we should expect the coriolis force to be \textit{smaller} in a cyclone than in an anticyclone. Since the corilis force scales as the wind speed $u_h$, we expect a cyclone to produce \textit{weaker} winds than an anti-cyclone for the same pressure gradients. Turning this on its head, if a cyclone and an anti-cyclone have similar wind-speeds, we expect the cyclone to have \textit{stronger} pressure gradients.

We can understand this algebraically as well. The force balance in the $r$-direction is as follows:
\begin{align}
    \label{GW Quadratic}
    \boxed{
        \frac{u_h^2}{r}+fu_h-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r}=0
    }
\end{align}
which is a quadratic equation for the velocity $u_h$, where $u_h>0$ if $u_h$ is spiraling in the anti-clockwise direction (in the northern hemisphere). \vspace{2mm}

\begin{minipage}{.48\linewidth}
    \centering
    For a cyclone, $u_h>0$
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{u_h^2}{r}+fu_h = \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r}
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{.48\linewidth}
    \centering
    For an anti-cyclone, $u_h<0$
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{u_h^2}{r} - \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} = -fu_h
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}

\vspace{2mm}
If we solve Equation \ref{GW Quadratic} directly, we find that $u_h$ is given by the following:
\begin{align*}
    u_h = \frac{r}{2} \left( 
        -f \pm \sqrt{f^2 + \frac{4}{\rho r}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r}}
     \right)
\end{align*}
So it turns out anticyclones (where $\frac{\partial p}{\partial r}<0$) really can't form in this simple model if $\left|\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r}\right|>\frac{rf^2}{4}$, i.e., if the pressure gradient is too large.

\section{Thermal Wind Balance}

Now that we have covered the fundamental diagnostic relations of \hyperref[Hydrostatic GFD Box]{Hydrostatic Balance} and \hyperref[Geostrophic Box]{Geostrophic Balance}, we now aim to put these two pieces of information together to find a relation between the horizontal velocity $\vec{u}_h$ and the temperature in an ideal gas atmosphere.

We begin with Equations \ref{Hydrostatic Ideal Gas} and \ref{Geostrophic Ideal Gas} expressing respectively hydrostatic and geostrophic balance for an ideal gas. We first take the partial derivative with respect to $z$ of Equation \ref{Geostrophic Ideal Gas}:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial\vec{u}_h}{\partial z}&=\frac{\partial}{\partial z} \left( \frac{R}{f}\vec{k}\times \left( T\vec{\nabla}_h \ln p \right) \right)
    &
    \text{ ; }
    &
    \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\text{ of Eqn. \ref{Geostrophic Ideal Gas}}
    \\
    &=\frac{R}{f}\vec{k}\times\left( 
        \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}\vec{\nabla}_h \ln p
        +
        T\vec{\nabla}_h \frac{\partial \ln p}{\partial z}
     \right)
    &
    \text{ ; }
    &
    \text{Assume }\frac{\partial \bar{M}}{\partial z}=0\text{ and that partial derivatives commute}
    \\
    &=\frac{R}{f}\vec{k}\times\left( 
        \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}\vec{\nabla}_h \ln p
        -
        T\vec{\nabla}_h \frac{g}{RT}
    \right)
    &
    \text{ ; }
    &
    \text{Substitute Eqn. \ref{Hydrostatic Ideal Gas} for }\frac{\partial \ln p}{\partial z}
    \\
    &=\frac{R}{f}\vec{k}\times\left( 
        \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}\vec{\nabla}_h \ln p
        +
        \frac{g}{RT}
        \vec{\nabla}_h T
    \right)
    &
    \text{ ; }
    &
    \text{Apply chain rule}
    \\
    &=\frac{R}{f}\vec{k}\times\left( 
        \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}\frac{f}{RT} \vec{k}\times\vec{u}_h
        +
        \frac{g}{RT}
        \vec{\nabla}_h T
    \right)
    &
    \text{ ; }
    &
    \text{Substitute Eqn. \ref{Geo Bal} for }\vec{\nabla}_h\ln p
\end{align*}

Now we estimate each term in the final brackets in the final equation:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \vec{u}_h}{\partial z}=\frac{1}{fT}\vec{k}\times\biggl( 
        \underbrace{\overbrace{\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}}^{\sim\qty{1e-2}{\kelvin\per\meter}}
        \overbrace{f}^{\sim\qty{1e-5}{\per\second}}
        \vec{k}\times
        \overbrace{\vec{u}_h}^{\sim\qty{10}{\meter\per\second}}}_{\sim \qty{1e-6}{\kelvin\per\square\second}}
        +
        \underbrace{\overbrace{g}^{\sim\qty{10}{\meter\per\square\second}}
        \overbrace{\vec{\nabla}_h T}^{\sim\qty{1e-5}{\kelvin\per\meter}}}_{\sim\qty{1e-4}{\kelvin\per\square\second}}
    \biggr)
\end{align*}

So we see that even though horizontal temperature gradients $\vec{\nabla}_h T$ are typically $1000$ times weaker than vertical temperature gradients $\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}$ (recall that horizontal temperature gradients roughly follow the Lapse Rate in Equation \ref{Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate}), it is the term that features the horizontal temperature gradient that ends up begin much larger than the term that features the vertical temperature gradient.

As such, we neglect\footnote{
    We do not actually have to neglect this term when we derive these equations in pressure coordinates!
} the term on the left in the equation, and derive the \textbf{Thermal Wind Equations}:
\begin{align}\label{Thermal Wind}
    \BOX{\frac{\partial\vec{u}_h}{\partial z}\approx\frac{g}{fT}\vec{k}\times\vec{\nabla}_hT}
\end{align}

Written out, each component of $\vec{u}_h=(u,v)^T$ is as follows:

\begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
    \begin{align}
        \label{u Thermal}
        \BOX{\frac{\partial u}{\partial z} \approx-\frac{g}{f T}\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}}
    \end{align}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
    \begin{align}
        \label{v Thermal}
        \BOX{\frac{\partial v}{\partial z} \approx \frac{g}{f T}\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}}
    \end{align}
\end{minipage}

The physical interpretation is as follows: if the system is approximately both \hyperref[Geostrophic Box]{Geostrophic} and \hyperref[Hydrostatic GFD Box]{Hydrostatic}, and obeys ideal gas law, then horizontal temperature gradients imply vertical velocity gradients (and vice versa).

Let us now consider the vertical component of the vorticity. Recall that the voriticity is defined as follows: $\vec{\omega}=\vec{\nabla}\times\vec{u}$. Therefore the vertical component is given by: $[\vec{\omega}]_z=\xi=\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$. If we differentiate Equations \ref{u Thermal} and \ref{v Thermal} with respect to $y$ and $x$ (respectively), then subtract them we can find an equation governing $\xi$:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial z} \right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} \right)
    \approx
    \frac{g}{fT}\left( 
        \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2}
     \right)\nonumber
     \\
    \label{Thermal Wind Vorticity}
    \therefore
    \BOX{
        \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}- \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right)=
        \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial z}
        \approx
        \frac{g}{fT}\vec{\nabla}_h^2 T
    }
\end{align}

Now in the \hyperref[VC Interp]{Vector Calculus Interpretation Box} we interpreted the meaning of the gradient of a scalar field, but we are yet to interpret the \textbf{divergence} of the \textbf{gradient} of a scalar field. In this case, we specifically considering $\vec{\nabla}_h^2 T$.

This encodes the \textit{curvature} of the temperature scalar field $T(\vec{r},t)$. You will find that, if the temperature is constant or if the temperature increases at a constant rate in some direction, that this will be $0$. However, if the temperature increases then decreases, or increases more and more, then this will be non-zero.

Therefore, Equation \ref{Thermal Wind Vorticity} essentially says that the vertical gradient of the vorticity $\xi$ is set by the curvature of the temperature field $T$. 

This might make more sense with a concrete example. Suppose that we have a blob of cold air, i.e., we have a temperature field $T(\vec{r})$ that is minimum at the centre of the blob and warmer around the blob. If we consider $\vec{\nabla}_h T(\vec{r})$ (which I remind you is a vector field which points from low $T$ to high $T$), we would expect the vector field to look like arrows pointing away from the cold centre. Therefore the divergence of this vector field $\vec{\nabla}_h^2 T$ will be \textbf{positive} at this cold blob.

If you wan't to think of this in terms of curvature, since the temperature decreases then increases again when you pass through this cold blob, this implies that the temperature field $T(\vec{r})$ must be curved.  

Using Equation \ref{Thermal Wind Vorticity} $\vec{\nabla}_h^2 T>0$ therefore implies that $\frac{\partial \xi}{\partial z}>0$ (in the northern hemisphere), therefore the vertical vorticity increases with height in this cold blob! Vice versa for a hot blob in the northern hemisphere: in a hot blob will have vorticity decreasing with height. 

\section{Pressure Coordinates}\label{Pressure Coords}
\subsection{Partial Derivative Identities}

To convert to pressure coordinates we must first introduce some identities from vector calculus involving partial derivatives. We will skip the proof, so you'll just have to take the following identities on trust:
\begin{align*}
    \left(\frac{\partial a}{\partial b}\right)_{c,d}=\left(\frac{\partial b}{\partial a}\right)_{c,d}^{-1}
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
    \left(\frac{\partial a}{\partial b}\right)_c
    \left(\frac{\partial b}{\partial c}\right)_a
    \left(\frac{\partial c}{\partial a}\right)_b
    =-1
\end{align*}
where we have explicitly written which variables are held constant in the subscripts. We apply this to $p$ and $z$:
\begin{align}
    \label{P inverse}
    \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}\right)_{x,y}=\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial p}\right)_{x,y}^{-1}
\end{align}
\begin{align*}
    \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\right)_z
    \left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial z}\right)_p
    \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial p}\right)_x
    =-1
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
    \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}\right)_z
    \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial z}\right)_p
    \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial p}\right)_y
    =-1
\end{align*}
where the last two equations become:
\begin{align}
    \label{P -1}
    \left(\vec{\nabla}_h p\right)_z=-\left(\vec{\nabla}_h z\right)_p\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}\right)_{x,y}
\end{align}

We must be careful with which variables we are actually holding constant when transforming from height coordinates to pressure coordinates. Before this section, we have implicitly held $z$ constant when calculating horizontal derivatives like $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ or $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$. In practice, you should memorise Equations \ref{P inverse} and \ref{P -1} if you wish to reproduce this in an exam.

We will now apply this to four equations: \hyperref[Hydrostatic GFD Box]{hydrostatic balance} (\ref{Hydrostatic GFD}), \hyperref[Geostrophic Box]{geostrophic balance} (\ref{Geostrophic Balance}), thermal wind balance (\ref{Thermal Wind}), and mass conservation (\ref{Mass Conservation}) to derive their equivalent form in pressure coordinates. 

\subsection{Hydrostatic Balance}

Starting first from the hydrostatic relation (Equation \ref{Hydrostatic GFD}), we derive the equivalent relation expressing hydrostatic balance but in pressure coordinates using Equation \ref{P inverse}:
\begin{align*}
    -\rho g &= \left( \frac{\partial p}{\partial z} \right)_{x,y}
    \\
    &=\left( \left( \frac{\partial z}{\partial p} \right)_{x,y} \right)^{-1}
\end{align*}
\begin{align}
    \label{Hydrostatic Pressure}
    \therefore \BOX{
        \left( \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial p} \right)_{x,y}
        =-\frac{1}{\rho}
    }
\end{align}
where we have defined the \textbf{geopotential height} $\Phi$ as follows:
\begin{align}
    \BOX{\Phi =g\,z}
\end{align}
There is nothing special about \textbf{geopotential height}. You can literally just think of \textbf{geopotential height} $\Phi$ as the height variable $z$ multiplied by $g$.

If we assume that the atmosphere consists of an ideal gas, then the following relation is the analogue for Equation \ref{Hydrostatic Balance Ideal}:
\begin{align}
    \boxed{\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \ln p}=-RT}
    \label{Hydrostatic Pressure Ideal}
\end{align}

\subsection{Geostrophic Balance}

We now turn to geostrophic balance. Again, starting from Equation \ref{Geostrophic Balance} but this time applying Equaiton \ref{P -1}:
\begin{align*}
    \vec{u}_h &= \frac{1}{\rho f}\vec{k}\times\left(\vec{\nabla}p\right)_z
    \\
    &=\frac{1}{\rho f}\vec{k}\times\left( 
        -\left( \vec{\nabla}_h z \right)_p \left( \frac{\partial p}{\partial z} \right)_{x,y}
     \right)
    \\
    &=\frac{1}{\rho f}\vec{k}\times\left( 
        -\left( \vec{\nabla}_h z \right)_p (-\rho g)
    \right)
\end{align*}
\begin{align}
    \label{Geostrophic Pressure}
    \therefore \BOX{
        \vec{u}_h = \frac{1}{f}\vec{k}\times\left( \vec{\nabla}_h \Phi \right)_p
    }
\end{align}
where we have used \hyperref[Hydrostatic GFD Box]{hydrostatic balance} to substitute for $\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}$. Each component of $\vec{u}_h$ is as follows:

\begin{minipage}{.48\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        \BOX{
            u = -\frac{1}{f}\left( \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial y} \right)_p
        }
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{.48\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        \BOX{
            v = \frac{1}{f}\left( \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x} \right)_p
        }
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Thermal Wind Balance}

Thermal Wind Balance is particularly elegant in pressure coordinates, as we do not need to make the awkward scale analysis approximation we did in deriving Equation \ref{Thermal Wind} in height coordinates. We still need to assume that the system is in hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, and that the system is an ideal gas. To derive thermal wind balance in pressure coordinates, we simply take the derivative of Equation \ref{Geostrophic Pressure} with respect to $\ln p$ (and make use of Equation \ref{Hydrostatic Pressure Ideal}):
\begin{align*}
    \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \ln p} \right)_{x,y}\left( \vec{u}_h \right)
    &= \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \ln p} \right)_{x,y}
    \left( \frac{1}{f}\vec{k}\times\left( \vec{\nabla}_h \Phi \right)_p \right)
    \\
    &= \frac{1}{f}\vec{k}\times\left( \vec{\nabla}_h \left( \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \ln p} \right)_{x,y} \right)_{p}
    \\
    &= \frac{1}{f}\vec{k}\times\left( \vec{\nabla}_h (-RT) \right)_{p}
\end{align*}
\begin{align}
    \therefore
    \BOX{
        \left( \frac{\partial \vec{u}_h}{\ln p} \right)_{x,y}
        =
        -\frac{R}{f}\vec{k}\times \left( \vec{\nabla}_h T \right)_p
    }
\end{align}
Again, each component of $\vec{u}_h$ is as follows:

\begin{minipage}{.48\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        \BOX{
            \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial \ln p} \right)_{x,y}
            =\frac{R}{f}
            \left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \right)_{p}
        }
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{.48\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        \BOX{
            \left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial \ln p} \right)_{x,y}
            =-\frac{R}{f}
            \left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \right)_{p}
        }
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Mass Conservation}

[DERIVATION UNDER CONSTRUCTION]

A final implication of converting to pressure coordinates is that we now have a new `vertical velocity'. The old vertical velocity was defined as follows:
\begin{align*}
    w_z = \frac{D z}{Dt}
\end{align*}
However, in pressure coordinates, we now define `vertical velocity' as follows:
\begin{align*}
    w_p = \frac{D p}{Dt}
\end{align*}

Again, assuming that the system is hydrostatic allows us to approximate $w_p$ the following way\footnote{
    Recall that the hydrostatic relation assumes that vertical variations in $p$ are dominant, therefore we can approximate the material derivative of $p$ as just the vertical advection component.
}:
\begin{align*}
    w_p &= \biggl( \underbrace{\frac{\partial }{\partial t} + u\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right)_{z}+v\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \right)_{z}}_{\text{small }\therefore \text{ neglect}}+\underbrace{w_z \frac{\partial}{\partial z}}_{\text{big}} \biggr)\, p
    \\
    &\approx w_z \left( \frac{\partial p}{\partial z} \right)_{x,y}
    \\
    & = -w_z\rho g
\end{align*}

Recall Equation \ref{Mass Conservation} which states the following (this applies for both incompressible and compressible fluids):
\begin{align*}
    \frac{D\rho}{Dt}+\rho\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{u}=0
\end{align*}

Writing this in pressure coordinates gives us:
\begin{align*}
    0&=\left( 
        \frac{\partial}{\partial t} 
        + \vec{u}_h \cdot \left( \vec{\nabla}_h \right)_z
        + w_z \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
    \right)\rho
    + \rho \left( 
        \left( \vec{\nabla}_h  \right)_z \cdot \vec{u}_h
        + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}w_z
    \right)
    \\
    &=\left( 
        \frac{\partial}{\partial t} 
        + \vec{u}_h \cdot \left( \vec{\nabla}_h \right)_z
        - \frac{w_p}{\rho g} \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}\frac{\partial}{\partial p}
    \right)\rho
    + \rho \left( 
        \left( \vec{\nabla}_h  \right)_z \cdot \vec{u}_h
        - \frac{\partial p}{\partial z} \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \frac{w_p}{\rho g}
    \right)
    \\
    &=\left( 
        \frac{\partial}{\partial t} 
        + \vec{u}_h \cdot \left( \vec{\nabla}_h \right)_z
        + w_p \frac{\partial}{\partial p}
    \right)\rho
    + \rho \left( 
        \left( \vec{\nabla}_h  \right)_z \cdot \vec{u}_h
        +\rho g \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \frac{w_p}{\rho g}
    \right)
\end{align*}


Recall Equation \ref{Mass Conservation} which states the following (for an incompressible fluid):
\begin{align*}
    \frac{D\rho}{Dt}=\left( \frac{\partial }{\partial t} + u\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right)_{z}+v\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \right)_{z}+w_z \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right)\rho = 0
\end{align*}





\chapter{The Shallow Water System: 2D System}\label{Shallow Water System}

\section{The Equations of Motion}

In the previous chapter, we considered diagnostic relations: \hyperref[Hydrostatic GFD Box]{Hydrostatic Balance} and \hyperref[Geostrophic Box]{Geostrophic Balance}. These are very useful and important relations, but notice that there are no time derivatives in \ref{Hydrostatic GFD} and \ref{Geostrophic Balance}. If there are no time-derivatives, the equations cannot reproduce non-steady state solutions and time-evolution. However, clearly, the atmosphere and ocean evolve and are not in a steady state, and we wish to understand this.

Our first tool to consider time-dependent changes is the shallow water system. We consider a system governed the following equations and looks like this:

\begin{fact}{The Shallow Water System}{shallow box}\label{shallow box}

    The Shallow Water System is a simple two-dimensional time-varying system governing the evolution of a thin layer of incompressible fluid subject only to the pressure gradient and coriolis force.

    The three state variables are the horizontal velocity $\vec{u}_h(x,y,t)=(u,v)^T$ and the layer thickness $h(x,y,t)$. Equivalently, we can express the state variables as the horizontal velocity $\vec{u}_h(x,y,t)=(u,v)^T$ and the layer height $\eta(x,y,t)$.

\end{fact}

We now aim to derive these equations from three primitive (approximate) equations: the horizontal momentum equation (\ref{Horizontal Approximate}), the vertical momentum equation (\ref{Vertical Approximate}), and mass conservation (\ref{Mass Conservation}). First, we neglect all vertical and horizontal forces $F_z$ and $\vec{F}_h$ (e.g. neglect friction) other than gravity and pressure gradient forces.

Second, we assume that the density is constant $\rho=\rho_0$ for all time and at all points. This immediately implies (from Equation \ref{Mass Conservation}) that the system must be incompressible, so we know that Equation \ref{Incompressibility} holds.

Third, we assume that the system is \textbf{shallow}: $H/L\ll 1$ where $H$ is the vertical lengthscale and $L$ is the horizontal lengthscale. If we non-dimensionalise \ref{Incompressibility}, we derive that the vertical velocity scale $W$ is much smaller than the horizontal velocity scale $U$: $W\ll U$:
\begin{align*}
    \vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{u}=0\\
    \underbrace{\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot\vec{u}_h}_{U/L}+\underbrace{\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}}_{W/H}=0\\
    \therefore \frac{U}{L}\sim\frac{W}{H}\text{   }\therefore
    \frac{W}{U}\sim\frac{H}{L}\\
    \therefore \boxed{W \ll U}
\end{align*}

We take this as justification for our fourth assumption: that vertical acceleration and advection is small compared to gravity and pressure gradient forces. As such, the system is in approximately in \hyperref[Hydrostatic GFD]{Hydrostatic Balance} (we have simplified Equation \ref{Vertical Approximate} here). Importantly, though, we do \textit{not} assume that the vertical acceleration/advection is $0$ everywhere. We simply assume that they are much smaller than vertical pressure gradients and gravity.

This allows us to integrate the hydrostatic relation from some reference height $\eta$ (the height of the surface) and pressure $p_s$ (the pressure at the surface) to find that the following holds (refer to Equation \ref{Const Density Hydrostatic} to see the derivation).
\begin{align*}
    p(x,y,z,t)=\rho g(\eta(x,y,t)-z)+p_s(x,y,t)
\end{align*}

Fifth, we assume that the fluid above the layer of fluid under consideration has a much lower viscocity than the current layer or that it is much less dense than the other positions. This allows us to assume that $\vec{\nabla}_hp_s\ll \vec{\nabla}_h\eta$, and that therefore $\vec{\nabla}_h p \approx \rho_0 g \vec{\nabla}_h \eta$. As such, Equation \ref{Horizontal Approximate} becomes the following:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{D\vec{u}_h}{Dt}+f\vec{k}\times\vec{u}_h=g\vec{\nabla}_h\eta
\end{align*}

Notice that everything on the right hand side has no dependence on $z$. However, it must hold for each all $z$ within the layer, therefore, we can conclude that $\vec{u}_h$ cannot depend on $z$ either.\footnote{
    If it did, then the $f\vec{k}\times\vec{u}_h$ term would depend on $z$ and so left hand side would depend on $z$. Depending on $z$ implies that its value would change depending on $z$, but the right hand side cannot change its value depending on $z$, and so the equation would not hold for some $z$.
} Therefore, we can neglect the vertical advection term in the material derivative:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{D}{Dt}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial}{\partial x}
    +v\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+\bcancel{w\frac{\partial}{\partial z}}
\end{align*}

This allows us to derive Equation \ref{SW mom}, which is an approximation of the horizontal momentum equation (\ref{Horizontal Approximate}):
\begin{align*}
    \boxed{\frac{D_h\vec{u}_h}{Dt}+f\vec{k}\times\vec{u}_h=g\vec{\nabla}_h\eta}
\end{align*}
where $\frac{D_h}{Dt}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+v\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$ is the horizontal material derivative.

The interpretation is as follows: this is just horizontal momentum balance, where the horizontal acceleration is set by the coriolis force and the pressure gradient force, and no other forces. The pressure gradient force only depends on the height of the surface of the fluid, and the height affects the pressure through the hydrostatic relation.

Let us now turn to Mass Conservation Equation \ref{Mass Conservation}. We already derived from the $\rho=\rho_0=const$ assumption that the system must be incompressible, so the following holds:
\begin{align*}
    \vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{u}=\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot\vec{u}_h+\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}=0
\end{align*}

Let us integrate this equation with respect to $z$ from $z=b(x,y)$ to $z=\eta(x,y,t)$ and recall first that $\vec{u}_h$ is not a function of $z$ and second that we assumed that $w$ was much smaller than $u,v$, not that $w=0$. This allows us to derive the following:
\begin{align*}
    \int_{b}^{\eta} 0 \,dz &= \int_{b}^{\eta} \vec{\nabla}_h\cdot\vec{u}_h+\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}\, dz\\
    0&=h(x,y,t)\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot\vec{u}_h+\left[ w \right]_b^\eta\\
    &=h\,\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot\vec{u}_h + w(z=\eta)-w(z=b)
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
    \therefore \boxed{0 = h\,\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot\vec{u}_h + w(z=\eta)-w(z=b)}
\end{align*}

Now it turns out (and this is justified by some fluid mechanical boundary conditions) that $w(z=\eta)=\frac{D_h \eta}{Dt}$ and $w(z=b)=\frac{D_h b}{Dt}$. The interpretation is as follows: the vertical velocity at an interface must be exactly equal to the change in interface height/depth following a fluid parcel, because if this weren't the case, we would get a fluid parcel phasing through the ground (as is the case at the bottom where $z=b$) or the fluid parcel is exactly what sets the change in the interface depth (as is the case at the top where $z=\eta$).

As such:
\begin{align*}
    w(z=\eta)-w(z=b)&=\frac{D_h \eta}{Dt}-\frac{D_h b}{Dt}\\
    &=\frac{D_h h}{Dt}\\
    &=\frac{\partial h}{\partial t}+ \vec{u}_h\cdot\vec{\nabla}_hh
\end{align*}

Therefore, we get that:
\begin{align*}
    0&=h\,\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot\vec{u}_h + w(z=\eta)-w(z=b)\\
    &=h\,\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot\vec{u}_h+\frac{\partial h}{\partial t}+ \vec{u}_h\cdot\vec{\nabla}_hh\\
    0&=\frac{\partial h}{\partial t}+\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot(h\vec{u}_h)
\end{align*}

We have derived Equation \ref{SW mass}. The interpretation for this equation is as follows: the height of a fluid can change, but it is constrained by the velocity of the fluid becauce the fluid is incompressible. If the height increases at some point, there must be more fluid flowing into that point than out of it, but since the fluid cannot compress, the height of the layer must increase.

We have derived all the equations of motion for the Shallow Water System, but the crux of the issue is whether or not this is a faithful representation of time-dependent geophysical fluid dynamics. Sadly, the details are quite complicated, and I'm not sure if I'll even get to them. If I do, they are at the end of this chapter in Section \ref{SW Justification}.

For now, just take this as granted, and let us start analysing this system.

\section{Energetics}

\subsection{Kinetic Energy and Available Potential Energy}

Let us first consider the energy in the shallow water system, which the sum of the kinetic energy and the (gravitational) potential energy. Again, we would prefer to work in intensive variables, so we find these per unit area.

The kinetic energy per unit area $KE$ is as follows:
\begin{align*}
    KE = \frac{1}{2}\underbrace{\rho_0\,V}_{m}\,u_h^2/A\\
    =\frac{1}{2}\rho_0\,A\,h/A\,u_h^2\\
    \therefore\BOX{KE = \frac{1}{2}\rho_0\,h\,u_h^2}
\end{align*}
where $u_h=|\vec{u}_h|$. The idea is simple: it's just the kinetic energy divided by the unit area.

The potential energy per unit area is a little bit more complicated. To find this, we need to consider all the fluid parcels from $z=b$ to $z=\eta$ and sum the potential energy of all the fluid parcels.

Let us first consider a fluid parcel at height $z$ with some height $dz$ and width $A$ (therefore, it has a volume equal to $A\,dz$ and mass equal to $\rho_0\,A\,dz$). The potential energy of \textit{this} parcel ($dPE$) is as follows:
\begin{align*}
    dPE=\underbrace{\rho_0\,a\,dz}_{m}g\,z
\end{align*}
We have to sum this over all the fluid parcels from $z=b$ to $z=\eta$ so our total potential energy per unit area $PE$ is as follows:
\begin{align*}
    PE &= \int_{z=b}^{z=\eta}dPE/A\\
    &= \int_{z=b}^{z=\eta}\underbrace{\rho_0\,A\,dz}_{m}g\,z/A\\
    &= \rho_0\,g\left[ \frac{1}{2}z^2 \right]_b^\eta\\
    &= \frac{1}{2}\rho_0\,g\left( \eta^2-b^2 \right)
\end{align*}

Now the final fiddly thing we have to do is to say that we don't actually care about the total potential energy – we care about the \textbf{available} potential energy. This is the potential energy available to be extracted by the system (by, e.g., conversion to kinetic energy). To find this, we must subtract the minimum potential energy from the total potential energy. The minimum potential energy state occurs if the surface is flat, i.e., if $\eta=const$. We can simply define our coordinate system such that $z=0$ at this flat surface so that $\eta=0$ and that $b<0$ in this minimum $PE$ state. Therefore, the minimum $PE$ density is:
\begin{align*}
    PE_{min}=-\frac{1}{2}\rho_0 \,g \,b^2
\end{align*}
Subtracting this off from our total $PE$ per unit area gives us the total available potential energy per unit area:
\begin{align*}
    \BOX{PE = \frac{1}{2}\rho_0 \,g\,\eta^2}
\end{align*}
So the kinetic energy scales as $h\,u_h^2$ while the available potential energy scales as $g\,\eta^2$.

\subsection{Conservation of Energy}

We will now derive conservation of energy in a shallow water system. We first take the dot product of Equation \ref{SW mom} and $\rho_0 \,h\,\vec{u}_h$. This gives us:
\begin{align*}
    0&=\rho_0 \,h\,\vec{u}_h\cdot\frac{\partial \vec{u}_h}{\partial t}+
    \rho_0 \,h\,\vec{u}_h\cdot \left( \vec{u}_h\cdot \vec{\nabla}_h \right)\vec{u_h}+
    f\rho_0 \,h\,\underbrace{\vec{u}_h\cdot \vec{k}\times\vec{u}_h}_{=0}+
    g\rho_0 \,h\,\vec{u}_h\cdot\vec{\nabla}_h\eta\\
    &=h\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \frac{1}{2}\rho_0 u_h^2 \right)
    +h \vec{u}_h\cdot\vec{\nabla}\left( \frac{1}{2}\rho_0 u_h^2 \right)
    +h\vec{u}_h\cdot\vec{\nabla}\left( \rho_0 g \eta \right)
\end{align*}
where we have used chain rule to bring the $u_h^2$'s inside the derivatives. We next multiply Equation \ref{SW mass} with $\frac{1}{2}\rho_0 u_h^2$ to get:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{2}\rho_0 u_h^2\frac{\partial h}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{2}\rho_0 u_h^2 \vec{\nabla}_h\cdot\left( h\vec{u}_h \right)=0
\end{align*}
Adding these two equations together, and recalling product rule for derivatives, gives an equation governing the kinetic energy:
\begin{align*}
    \underbrace{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \frac{1}{2}\rho_0 h u_h^2 \right)}_{\text{Change in }KE}
    +\underbrace{\vec{\nabla}_\cdot\left( \vec{u}_h \frac{1}{2}\rho_0 h u_h^2 \right)}_{\text{Convergence/Divergence of }KE}
    +\underbrace{h\vec{u}_h \cdot\vec{\nabla}(\rho_0 g \eta)}_{\text{Conversion of }KE\text{ to }APE}=0
\end{align*}

Let us take some time to interpret this equation. The first term is straightforward: it is just the local change in $KE$ per unit time. The second term is the convergence or divergence of $KE$.

indicated by the second term, or from $APE$ being converted into $KE$. The second term is a flux because is the divergence of the kinetic 

We can form an equation governing potential energy directly by multiplying Equation \ref{SW mass} with $\rho_0 g \eta$:
\begin{align*}
    \underbrace{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \frac{1}{2}\rho_0 g \eta^2\right)}_{\text{Change in }PE}
    +\underbrace{\rho_0 g \eta \vec{\nabla}\cdot \left( h\vec{u}_h \right)}_{\text{Conversion of }APE\text{ to }KE}
\end{align*}

Adding these equations together, we get an energy budget equation:
\begin{gather}
    \label{SW Energy}
    \BOX{
        \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\biggl( \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}\rho_0 h u_h^2 + \frac{1}{2}\rho_0 g \eta^2}_{E} \biggr)
        +
        \vec{\nabla}\cdot\biggl( 
            \underbrace{h\rho_0\vec{u}_h \left( \frac{1}{2}u_h^2+g\eta \right)}_{\vec{S}}
         \biggr)
        =0
    }\\
    \label{SW Energy Short}
    \frac{\partial E}{\partial t}+\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{S}=0
\end{gather}
where $E$ is the total energy per unit area and $\vec{S}$ is the energy flux vector. 

This is not just an energy conservation equation, it is a \textit{local} energy conservation equation. A local energy conservation equation imposes the constraint that change in the total energy at any point $E$ must be exactly equal to the energy flux $\vec{S}$ entering or leaving that area.

If we integrate equation \ref{SW Energy Short} around some closed area $A$ with some boundary $L$, we can apply the divergence theorem to find the following holds:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\iint_A E \,dx\,dy = -\int_L \vec{S}\cdot\vec{n}\,dl
\end{align*}

Physically, $E$ and $\vec{S}$ are straightforward to interpret. $E$, is the total energy, which is the sum of the kinetic and available potential energies. $\vec{S}$ is the energy flux vector.

\section{Potential Vorticity}\label{PV}

We define the \textbf{potential vorticity} (\textbf{PV}) $Q$ in this context as follows:
\begin{align*}
    \boxed{Q = \frac{f+\xi}{h}}
\end{align*}
$Q$ is the absolute vorticity in the $z$-direction $[\vec{\omega}_a]_z$, which is the sum of the planetary vorticity in the $z$-direction $f$ (the coriolis parameter!) and the relative vorticity in the $z$ direction $\xi=\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$, divided by the thickness of the layer $h$.

In a way, we can think of \textbf{PV} as encoding the two important properties of GFD: rotation and stratification. The rotation is encoded by the $f+\xi$ term, which is the total (planetary+relative) vorticity in the $z$-direction. The stratification is encoded by the layer thickness $h$. If $h$ is small, then this implies that the layer of constant density is very thin, which implies that density in the broader fluid increases rapidly with height. Conversely, if $h$ is large, then this implies that the layer of constant density is very thick, which implies that density in the broader fluid increases very slowly with height.

\subsection{Material Conservation of Potential Vorticity}

\subsubsection{Derivation}

We first take the $z$ component of the curl Equation \ref{SW mom} (and recalling that $f\neq const$):
\begin{align*}
    \frac{D_h}{Dt}\left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}- \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right) + \left( \frac{\partial (fv)}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial (fu)}{\partial x}\right) = 0
    \\
    \therefore \frac{D_h \xi}{Dt} + \vec{\nabla}_h \cdot \left( f\vec{u}_h \right)= \frac{D_h \xi}{Dt} + f\vec{\nabla}_h \cdot\vec{u}_h + \vec{u}_h \cdot \vec{\nabla}_h f = 0
\end{align*}
Next, we rearrange Equation \ref{SW mass} as follows:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{D_h h}{Dt}+h\vec{\nabla}_h \cdot \vec{u}_h=0
\end{align*}
We now cancel out the $\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot \vec{u}_h$ in both equations to obtain:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{D_h \xi}{Dt} - \frac{f}{h}\frac{D_h h}{Dt} + \vec{u_h}\cdot\vec{\nabla}f = 0
\end{align*}
Recalling that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}=0$, therefore that $\vec{u_h}\cdot\vec{\nabla}f=\frac{D_h f}{Dt}$, we rewrite the equation just in terms of material derivatives then divide the whole equation by $h$:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{h}\frac{D_h \xi}{Dt} +\frac{1}{h}\frac{D_h f}{Dt} - \frac{f}{h^2}\frac{D_h h}{Dt}=0
\end{align*}
Using product rule, this implies the following:

\begin{fact}{Material Conservation of Potential Vorticity}{Cons PV Box}\label{Cons PV Box}
    For a shallow water system, the \textbf{Potential Vorticity} (\textbf{PV}) $Q$ is materially conserved: 

    \begin{minipage}{.48\linewidth}
        \begin{align}
        \label{SW Cons PV}
        \BOX{
            \frac{D_h Q}{Dt}=0
        }
    \end{align}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}{.48\linewidth}
        \begin{align}
        \BOX{
            Q = \frac{f+\xi}{h}
        }
    \end{align}
    \end{minipage}
    
    \vspace{2mm} where $\xi=\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$ the relative vorticity. In other words, following a fluid parcel, the potential vorticity remains constant.
\end{fact}

\subsubsection{Interpretation}

We can interpret material conservation of potential vorticity by considering an infinitesimally thin column of fluid.

This column of fluid lies between the bottom ($z=b$) and top ($z=\eta$) of the layer, and is infintesimally thin. We impose that the column is infinitesimally thin to ensure that $u$, $v$, and $h$ do not vary appreciably over the entire column. However, we \textit{must} consider the entire column of fluid because our assumption (in the derivation) that $u$ and $v$ do not vary with $z$.

As this column of fluid is advected around, it must conserve its angular momentum in the $z$-direction. Suppose the column is initially rotating with some (total) angular velocity. If the column is stretched (i.e., if $h$ increases), it become thinner (because the total volume of the column remains constant), and so it must therefore rotate faster to conserve angular momentum.

\section{A Brief Primer on Waves}

In the previous section, we derived geostrophic balance and  hydrostatic balance.

However, the Earth is never in perfect balance, and perturbations and anomalies will occur, either because we have built a wind farm, or the sun is radiating differently, or because freshwater is being injected into certain areas in the oceans.

We analyse how systems respond to these anomalies by looking for wave-like solutions: we plug in a solution that is proportional to $\exp(i(\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}-\omega t))$, where $\vec{k}=(k_x,k_y,k_z)^T\in\mathbb{R}^3$ is the angular wavevector (the vector analogue of the wavenumber – refer to Section \ref{F, W, W} if you've forgotton what a wavenumber is) and $\omega$ is the angular frequency.

The justification for plugging in this somewhat convoluted function is as follows. We want a function that is simple enough such that the solution is easy to interpret. However, we also want a function complicated enough such that it can encode certain spatial and time dependencies. This is why we pick the exponential function, which is simple, which depends on a linear sum of space and time, which. More fundamentally, any function can be approximated by a sum of periodic complex function like $\exp(i(\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}-\omega t))$.

In practice, though, you don't have to really think about this, and you can just plug in $\exp(i(\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}-\omega t))$ into the equations of motion. After plugging these in, we will find that $\vec{k}$ and $\omega$ are constrained by these equations, and solving for this constraint gives us a \textbf{Dispersion Relation}:
\begin{align*}
    \omega=\omega(\vec{k})
\end{align*}

In other words, the frequency with which the perturbation oscillates is set by the spatial scale (or vice versa). This will give us valuable information regarding how these waves propogate.

\subsection{The wave-vector and the angular frequency}

Physically, the wave-vector encodes the direction the wavefronts face. To see this, consider some field $p$ which is proportional to $\exp(i(\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}-\omega t))$, i.e., let $p = p_0 \exp(i(\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}-\omega t))$. Let us draw contours of constant $p$ at some time $t$. To draw these contours, we solve for the values of $\vec{x}$ that solve the following equation:
\begin{align*}
    p(\vec{x},t)=const
\end{align*}
where $const$ is just any value (picking a different $const$ will give you a different contour).

Since $p\sim\exp(i(\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}-\omega t))$, this implies that $p$ is constant only for the values where $\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}$ is constant. These are picked out by the spatial points $\vec{x}$ that can be written as follows:
\begin{align*}
    &\vec{x} = \vec{x}_0+\delta\vec{x}
    \\
    &\text{where }\delta\vec{x}\perp \vec{k}\text{ and }\vec{x}_0=another\,\, const
\end{align*}
Therefore the contours of constant $p$, or the wavefronts, are perpendicular to $\vec{k}$:

Note, crucially, that it need not be the case that the energy or the wavefronts propagate in the direction of $\vec{k}$.}
    \label{Wavefronts Fig}
\end{figure}

However, $\vec{k}$ only really tells you about the wavelengths in each dimension and the orientation of the wavefronts. It \textbf{does not} tell you which direction the energy or the wavefronts propagate in. These propagate at the \textbf{phase} and \textbf{group} velocities, which we will talk about now.

\subsection{The Phase and Group Velocities}

The peaks and troughs in the wave (i.e., the wavefronts) will propogate with a \textbf{phase velocity} denoted by $\vec{c}_p$, where the $i$th component $[\vec{c}_p]_i$ is found as follows:
\begin{align}
    \label{Phase Velocity}
    \BOX{[\vec{c}_p]_i=\frac{\omega}{[\vec{k}]_i}}
\end{align}

Meanwhile, the wave-packet and the energy will propogate with a \textbf{group velocity} denoted by $\vec{c}_g$, where the $i$th component $[\vec{c}_g]_i$ is found as follows:
\begin{align}
    \label{Group Velocity}
    \BOX{[\vec{c}_g]_i=\frac{\partial\omega}{\partial [\vec{k}]_i}}
\end{align}
For example, in the $x$ direction, the \textbf{group} and \textbf{phase velocities} are found as follows:
\begin{align*}
    [\vec{c}_p]_x=\frac{\omega}{k_x}\\
    [\vec{c}_g]_x=\frac{\partial\omega}{\partial k_x}
\end{align*}

This is a slightly confusing distinction, as you've most likely only encountered non-dispersive waves in the past, and non-dispersive waves are waves such that the phase velocity is equal to the group velocity ($\vec{c}_g=\vec{c}_p$). Since I can't insert any animations into these pdf notes, I'd highly recommend clicking on \href{https://resource.isvr.soton.ac.uk/spcg/tutorial/tutorial/Tutorial_files/Web-further-dispersive.htm}{this} website on dispersive waves. I'd especially pay attention to the little animations.

Now that you've thoroughly read that resource, we can interpret what this means in our context. Suppose that the pressure perturbation is proportional to $\exp(i(\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}-\omega t))$ where $\omega=\omega(\vec{k})$ such that $\vec{c}_p=\vec{c}_p(\vec{k})$ and $\vec{c}_g=\vec{c}_g(\vec{k})$. Peaks and troughs propagate with a velocity set by the \textbf{phase velocity} $\vec{c}_p=\vec{c}_p(\vec{k})$, so areas of low or high pressure (i.e., cyclones and anti-cyclones in mid-/high-latitudes) propogate at the velocity $\vec{c}_p$. Meanwhile, the amplitude of this low or high pressure perturbation propagates with a velocity set by the \textbf{group velocity} $\vec{c}_g=\vec{c}_g(\vec{k})$. You saw that, in general, this means that the energy propagates with the \textbf{group velocity}, \textit{not} the \textbf{phase velocity}.

\section{Inertia-Gravity/Poincaré Waves}\label{2D Poincare}

\subsection{Derivation}

We first linearise the Shallow Water Equations about a state of rest $\vec{U}=0$ and layer thickness $H$. For simplicity we assume a flat bed $b=-H=const$. This is the first time we linearise in this course, so I will go through this a bit more carefully.

First, we write our variables as a sum of the unvarying quantity and the small perturbation:
\begin{align*}
    \vec{u}_h=\vec{U}+\vec{u}'\\
    h = H + h'\\
    \eta = N + \eta'
\end{align*}
where $H\gg h'$ and $N\gg \eta'$.\footnote{
    You might notice that we haven't required $|\vec{U}|\gg \vec{u}'$. This is because, strictly speaking, $\vec{U}=0$, so there is no way for $\vec{U}$ to be much larger than $\vec{u}'$. We need some other criterion on what we require for $\vec{u}'$ to be `small'.
}

Second, we substitute these equations into the shallow water equations, then eliminate terms that are not zeroth or first order in the primed quantites. For example, for Equation \ref{SW height}:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( H+h' \right)+\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot \left( (H+h')(\vec{U}+\vec{u}') \right)=0\\
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( H+h' \right)+\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot \left( H\vec{U}+H\vec{u}'+h'\vec{U}+\bcancel{h'\vec{u}'} \right)=0
\end{align*}

Third, we use the fact that $H$, $N$, and $\vec{U}$ are constant (and that $\vec{U}=0$).
\begin{align*}
    \bcancel{\frac{\partial H}{\partial t}}+ \frac{\partial h'}{\partial t}+\bcancel{\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot \left( H\vec{U} \right)}+\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot \left(H\vec{u}'\right)+\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot \left(h'\bcancel{\vec{U}} \right)=0\\
    \frac{\partial h'}{\partial t}+H\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot\vec{u}'=0
\end{align*}

Doing the same for equation \ref{SW mom} allows us to derive the \textbf{Linearised Shallow Water Equations}.

\begin{fact}{The Linearised Shallow Water Equations}{L SW Eqn}\label{L SW Eqn}
    Linearising the \hyperref[Shallow Water System]{Shallow Water System} with a flat bottom ($b=-H$) about a state of rest where $u=v=\eta=0$ and $h=H$ by keeping only terms first order in small primed variables gives rise to the following equations: 
    \begin{gather}
        \label{SW Lin mass}
        \BOX{\frac{\partial \eta'}{\partial t}+H\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot \vec{u}'=0}\\
        \label{SW Lin mom}
        \BOX{
            \frac{\partial \vec{u}'}{\partial t}+f\vec{k}\times\vec{u}'
            +
            g\vec{\nabla}_h \eta'=0
        }
    \end{gather}
    Note that it is also possible to linearise the shallow water system about other background states. E.g., we could have lineraised about a state of $v=\eta=0$, $h=H$, and $u=U$. This would analyse perturbations about a mean zonal flow.

    While we use these equations to analyse the time-dependent response of anomalies, note that actual phenomena are not always sufficiently represented by a linearised system – sometimes the anomalies are not small relative to the background state!
\end{fact}

I will now derive it slightly different to how Tim does it in his lecture series. In his lecture series, he does some cross differentiating and adding to eliminate $\vec{u}'$ for an equation only in $\eta'$. While this is more general than what I'm about to do, it is also (in my humble opinion) a bit less straightforward and hard to remember than what i'm about to do. Plus, both methods generate the same answer anyways.

We now let the following obtain for $\eta'$ and $\vec{u}'$:\footnote{
    You might be suspicious about what we've done here. After all, how can the height of a fluid be a complex number? You're right in that, strictly speaking, we should require that $\eta'\in\mathbb{R}$. We can remedy this by simply stipulating that $\eta'=\text{Re }\left( \eta' \right)$ (to abuse notation).
}
\begin{align*}
    &\eta' = \eta_0 \exp\left( ikx+ily-i\omega t \right)\\
    &\vec{u}' = \vec{u}_0' \exp\left( ikx+ily-i\omega t \right)=\left( \begin{array}{c}
        u_0\\v_0
    \end{array} \right)\exp\left( ikx+ily-i\omega t \right)
\end{align*}

Substituting this into the linearised shallow water equations gives us the following three equations:
\begin{align*}
    \left( -i\omega\eta_0 + H (iku_0+ilv_0) \right)\exp\left( ikx+ily-i\omega t \right)=0\\
    \left( -i\omega u_0-fv_0+gik\eta_0 \right)\exp\left( ikx+ily-i\omega t \right)=0\\
    \left( -i\omega v_0+fu_0+gil\eta_0 \right)\exp\left( ikx+ily-i\omega t \right)=0
\end{align*}

Because these equations must apply for all $x,y,t$, we must impose that the coefficient in front of the exponential must be $0$. We therefore get the following equations:
\begin{align*}
    -i\omega\,\eta_0 + iHk\,u_0+iHl\,v_0 =0
    \\
    igk\,\eta_0-i\omega\, u_0-f\,v_0+ =0
    \\
    igl\,\eta_0+f\,u_0-i\omega \,v_0=0
    \\
    \therefore
    \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
        -\omega & Hk & Hl \\
        igk & -i\omega & -f\\
        igl & f & -i\omega
    \end{array} \right)
    \left( \begin{array}{c}
        \eta_0\\
        u_0\\
        v_0
    \end{array} \right)
    =\vec{0}
\end{align*}

Our goal is to find the dispersion relation governing $\omega=\omega(k,l)$, but we want this dispersion relation to be arbitrary regardless of $\eta_0$, $u_0$, and $v_0$ (and we expect these to be set by the nature of the initial perturbation that generates the waves). We also require that these $\eta_0$, $u_0$, $v_0\neq 0$ so that we have non-trivial solutions (the trivial solution, is, of course, $\eta'=0$, $\vec{u}_h'=\vec{0}$).

We can go about this two ways. First, we can just eliminate $\eta_0$, $u_0$, $v_0$ via some algebra and this is fairly straightforward. Second, we write this in matrix form, as I have above, and recall(?) that if a matrix times a non-zero vector is equal to 0, then the determinant of the matrix must be zero. Using this second time-saving method we get:
\begin{align*}
   0 &=\det\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
        -\omega & Hk & Hl \\
        igk & -i\omega & -f\\
        igl & f & -i\omega
    \end{array} \right)
   \\
   &=-\omega \left|\begin{array}{cc}
        -i\omega & -f\\
        f & -i\omega
    \end{array} \right|
    -Hk \left|\begin{array}{cc}
        igk & -f\\
        igl & -i\omega
    \end{array} \right|
    +Hl \left|\begin{array}{cc}
        igk & -i\omega\\
        igl & f
    \end{array} \right|
    \\
    &=-\omega\left( -\omega^2+f^2 \right)
    -Hk \left( gk\omega +\bcancel{igfl} \right)
    +Hl \left( \bcancel{igfk} -gl\omega \right)
    \\
    0&=\omega\left( \omega^2 - f^2 - gH \left( k^2+l^2 \right) \right)
\end{align*}

We therefore obtain the following dispersion relation for \textbf{Poincaré/Inertia-Gravity Waves}:
\begin{align}
    \BOX{\omega=0}\,\text{ or }\,\BOX{\omega^2 = f^2 + gH \left( k^2 + l^2 \right)}
\end{align}

The first $\omega=0$ solution implies that the wave is in a steady state, and does not propogate (since $\vec{c}_p=\vec{c}_g=0$). Plugging this into Equation \ref{SW Lin mom} (exercise!) shows that $\vec{u}_h'$ is geostrophic!

The second $\omega^2=f^2+gH\left( k^2+l^2 \right)$ solution is more interesting. We now make an important simplification for ease of analysis. We call this the \textbf{$f$-plane approximation}.

\begin{fact}{The $f$-Plane Approximation}{f plane box}\label{f plane box}
    The \textbf{$f$-plane approximation} is the approximation where the coriolis parameter $f$ is treated as constant:
    \begin{align*}
        \BOX{f\approx2\Omega\sin\phi_0=const}
    \end{align*}
    where $\phi_0$ is the approximate latitude.
    
    Recall that, in reality, the coriolis parameter is actually $f=2\Omega \sin \phi$, where $\phi=$ the latitude. Recalling that $y$ is the north-ward pointing coordinate, we expect $\phi=\phi(y)$ so that $f=f(y)$. The \textbf{f-plane approximation} ignores this, and approximates $\phi=const$.
\end{fact}

Having made this simplification, we can make two further simplifications. First, we let $l=0$ without loss of generality\footnote{
    We can make this simplification without loss of generality because fo the following reason: the shallow water system with an $f-$plane approximation is isotropic in the $x,y$, plane, so, for any wave-vector $\vec{k}=(k,l)^T$ we can just rotate the coordinate system to align with the $k$ vector and the dynamics remain unchanged. As such, we can set $l=0$, because for any wave with a non-zero $l$, we can just reorient our coordinate system such that our $x$-axis aligns with the wavevector $\vec{k}$ so that $l=0$.
}. Second, we only consider the $\omega>0$ solution. There is a difference between the $\omega>0$ and $\omega<0$ solution, but this isn't too relevant to what we wish to discuss (Exercise: solve for $u_0$, $v_0$ in terms of $\eta_0$ and show that the sign of $\omega$ affects this).

\subsection{Interpretation}

With our simplifications, our dispersion relation looks like this:

\begin{fact}{Inertial-Gravity/Poincaré Dispersion Relation}{IG SW box}\label{IG SW Box}
    The dispersion relation for Poincaré/Inertia-Gravity Waves in a Shallow Water System is as follows:
\begin{align*}
    \BOX{\omega(k)=(f^2+\underbrace{gH}_{gH\equiv c^2}\, k^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}}
\end{align*}
where we have defined $c\equiv \sqrt{gH}=$ the speed\footnote{The phase or the group velocity? Wait and see\dots} at which gravitational waves propagate. If we plot $\omega(k)$, it looks like this:

    \label{Poincaré Graph}
\end{figure}
\end{fact}

\subsubsection{The Phase and Group Velocities}

Let us now calculate the phase and group velocities $c_p$ and $c_g$, which, I remind you, is the speed at which peaks/troughs and wave-packets/energy (respectively) propagate.
\begin{align*}
    c_p = \frac{\omega}{k}=\frac{\sqrt{f^2+c^2k^2}}{k}\\
    c_g = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k}=\frac{c^2k}{\sqrt{f^2+c^2k^2}}=\frac{c^2}{c_p^2}
\end{align*}
Doing some algebraic malipulation allows us to derive the following relation:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{c_g}{c_p}=\frac{\omega^2-f^2}{\omega^2}
\end{align*}
which implies that it is always the case that $c_p>c_g$. Therefore, peaks and troughs travel faster than a wavepacket or energy does.

Let us now interpret directly the mechanisms that control the propagation of this wave (i.e., how Poincaré waves may propagate of anomalies). To do this, let us look at what $\omega(k)$ in the limit of very large and very small $k$. Of course, when we say $k$ is large or small, we must specify large or small \textit{relative to what}. To this end, we define the \textbf{Rossby Deformation Radius} $L_d$ as follows:
\begin{fact}{The Rossby Deformation Radius for a Shallow Water System}{SW Def Radius Box}\label{SW Def Radius Box}
    We define the \textbf{Rossby Deformation Radius} $L_d$ for a Shallow Water System as follows:
    \begin{gather}
        \BOX{L_d = \frac{\sqrt{gH}}{f}}
    \end{gather}
    The Rossby deformation radius is a lengthscale which demarcates roughly when phenomena start `feeling' the effects of planetary rotation and the coriolis force. 

    Phenomena occuring on lengthscales much shorter than $L_d$ do not `feel' the effects of rotation. Phenomena occuring on lengthscales much larger than $L_d$ `feel' the effects of rotation strongly.
\end{fact}

To convince you of this fact, consider the following argument. Suppose that our horizontal velocity scale $U$ is set by the speed at which gravitational waves propagate, i.e., $U\sim\sqrt{gH}$. We know that the \hyperref[Rossby Box]{Rossby Number} indicates whether rotation is important relative to inertia: if $Ro\ll 1$, then rotation is important and vice versa.

$Ro=1$ exactly when the lengthscale $L=L_d$. Therefore if $L\gg L_d$, then $Ro\ll1$, therefore rotation is important, adn vice versa.

We now consider the large and small $k$ limits. Recall that $k$ is the wavenumber, and so the wavelength of the wave $\lambda\sim 1/k$. Therefore the lengthscale of the wave $L\sim\lambda\sim 1/k$. Therefore if $k$ is very large, then the lengthscale $L$ is very short, and vice versa. It is for this reason that we call the following limits the \textbf{short-wave} and \textbf{long-wave} limits.

\subsubsection{The Short-Wave Limit and the Gravity Wave Mechanism}

In the \textbf{short-wave limit}, the wavelength of the wave is \textbf{very small}, so we impose that $L\ll L_d$ and therefore that $k \gg 1/L_d$. In this limit, $c^2k^2\gg f^2$, and so in the shortwave limit:
\begin{align*}
    \boxed{\omega(k)\approx ck = \sqrt{gH}k}
\end{align*} 

In the \textbf{short-wave} limit then, the wave is what we call a \textbf{gravity wave}, and feels no effects of rotation! We can also think of this in terms of the Rossby Number. If $U\sim\sqrt{g H}$ and $L\ll L_d$, this implies that $Ro\gg 1$. Since there is no other intrinsic timescale here, we can conclude that the the $f\vec{k}\times\vec{u}_h$ is much smaller than both terms in Equation \ref{SW Lin mom}.

Such a wave is \textbf{non-dispersive}, meaning that $c_g=c_p$. Calculating $c_g$ and $c_p$ in this limit shows the following to obtain:
\begin{align*}
    c_p = c=\sqrt{gH}\\
    c_g = c=\sqrt{gH}
\end{align*}
So gravity waves propagate at the speed $c$, and do not disperse: the wave-packet stays together!

Recall that energy propagates at the group velocity $c_g$. Therefore, small length-scale anomalies can propagate across the atmosphere/ocean at the speed $c_g$. 

Now we can explain the mechanism for wave propagation in the \textbf{short-wave} limit. Suppose some phenomena generates a $\eta'$ anomaly (for example, a hump in $\eta'$). Therefore, at this point, $\vec{\nabla}_h \eta'\neq 0$. Recalling that the gradient of $\eta'$ is a vector field pointing from low $\eta'$ to high $\eta'$, $\vec{\nabla}_h \eta'$ will look like a vector field with vectors all pointing towards the centre of the hump.

Referring to Equation \ref{SW Lin mom} and neglecting the coriolis term implies that $\frac{\partial \vec{u}'}{\partial t}\neq 0$, and must be equal and opposite to $\vec{\nabla}_h \eta'$. Therefore, $\frac{\partial \vec{u}'}{\partial t}$ looks like a vector field pointing outwards, so the fluid accelerates away from this hump.

The fluid accelerating away from this hump implies further that there is no a divergence of fluid at this hump and a convergence of fluid around the hump. Therefore $\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot\vec{u}'>0$ at the hump and $\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot\vec{u}'<0$ around the hump. Therefore, from Equation \ref{SW Lin mass}, at the hump $\frac{\partial \eta'}{\partial \eta'}<0$ and around the hump $\frac{\partial \eta'}{\partial \eta'}>0$ so the hump spreads outwards and this is how the wave propagates.

Physically, what is occuring is that $\eta'$ anomalies generate in pressure anomalies (from the hydrostatic relation), and these pressure anomalies generate $\vec{u}'$ anomalies, which turn generate $\eta'$ anomalies, which propagates the wave. This is why we call these \textbf{gravity waves}, because the restoring force is gravity (as gravity is what generates the pressure anomalies via the hydrostatic relation).

\subsubsection{The Long-Wave Limit and the Inertia/Coriolis Wave Mechanism}

Let us now look at the \textbf{long-wave limit}. In the \textbf{long-wave limit}, the wavelength of the wave is \textbf{very large}, so we impose that $L\gg L_d$ and therefore that $k \ll 1/L_d$. In this limit, $c^2k^2\ll f^2$, and so in the long-wave limit:
\begin{align*}
    \boxed{\omega(k)\approx f}
\end{align*}

In the \textbf{long-wave} limit, then, the wave is just an inertial oscillation: the wave feels only the effects of the coriolis force, and feels no effects of gravity. Again, we can also think of this in terms of the Rossby Number.

Let us now calculate $c_g$ and $c_p$ in this limit:
\begin{align*}
    c_p = \frac{f}{k}\\
    c_g = 0
\end{align*}
Again, recalling that energy propagates at the group velocity, we can conclude that large length-scale anomalies are `trapped': large length-scale anomalies \textit{cannot} propagate away from the source. 

To explain this, let us consider the mechanism for how this wave sustains itself. In this limit, rotation is dominant. Suppose, again, that there is some surface height $\eta'$ anomaly. This, again, would imply that $\vec{\nabla}_h\eta'\neq 0$, which by Equation \ref{SW Lin mom} would implies that $f\vec{k}\times\vec{u}'\neq0$.

Since $c_g=0$, \textbf{long-wave} Poincaré waves cannot transport energy, so in general this will not be the mechanism for propagation of long length-scale anomalies. We must turn to other mechanisms to explain this.

\subsubsection{Energetics}

\section{Rossby Waves}

\subsection{The \texorpdfstring{$\beta$}{Beta}-Plane Approximation}

Before we discuss Rossby Waves, we must first introduce the $\beta$-plane approximation. The $\beta$-plane approximation is our step-up from the $f$-plain approximation of the coriolis $f$ parameter. Now, instead of crudely approximating $f=const$, we allow $\beta$ to vary linearly in $y$.

The idea is as follows. We first Taylor Expand the coriolis parameter $f$ about some latitude $\phi_0$:
\begin{align*}
    f(\phi)&=2\Omega \sin \phi\\
    &\approx \underbrace{2\Omega \sin \phi_0}_{f(\phi_0)}+\underbrace{2\Omega \cos \phi_0}_{f'(\phi_0)} (\phi-\phi_0)
\end{align*}

Next, we approximate the north-south coordinate $y\approx a\phi$ (this amounts to the assumption that the $y$ is small enough such that the Earth can be treated as roughly flat at that point).
\begin{fact}{The $\beta$-Plane Approximation}{beta plane box}\label{beta plane box}
    The \textbf{$\beta$-plane approximation} is the approximation where the coriolis parameter $f$ is treated as linear in $y$:
    \begin{align*}
        \BOX{f\approx \underbrace{2\Omega\sin\phi_0}_{\equiv f_0}+\underbrace{\frac{2\Omega\cos\phi_0}{a}}_{\beta} (y-y_0)}
    \end{align*}
    where $\beta=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$.

    We require $y-y_0\ll a$ for this approxmation to be accurate. This approximation can also be thought of as a Taylor Expansion of $f$ about $y=y_0$.
\end{fact}

\subsection{Derivation}

Our derivation of Rossby Waves is a little bit different from just plugging in an exponential solution. First, for simplicity, we assume that $b=const$ for simplicity. This implies that $\vec{\nabla}_h h'=\vec{\nabla}_h \eta'$ for simplicity. 

Second, we rearange Equation \ref{SW Lin mom} for the $\vec{u}_h'$ in the coriolis term to find the following:

\begin{minipage}{.48\linewidth}
    \begin{align}
        \label{u Ro}
        u'=-\frac{g}{f}\frac{\partial h'}{\partial y}-\underbrace{\frac{1}{f}\frac{\partial v'}{\partial t}}_{\text{small}}
    \end{align}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{.48\linewidth}
    \begin{align}
        \label{v Ro}
        v'=\frac{g}{f}\frac{\partial h'}{\partial x}+\underbrace{\frac{1}{f}\frac{\partial u'}{\partial t}}_\text{small}
    \end{align}
\end{minipage}

Third, we assume that $Ro\ll 1$, therefore, we expect the flow to be approximately in geostrophic balance. We therefore approximate the second term in both of the above equations as small (as I've written).

Fourth, we rewrite those small terms by resubstituting in $v'$ and $u'$ and taking the time derivative. We do this by More taking our expression for $v'$ in Equation \ref{v Ro}, then substitute $v'$ into the small right-hand term in Equation \ref{u Ro}:
\begin{align*}
    u'&=-\frac{g}{f}\frac{\partial h'}{\partial y}-\frac{1}{f}\frac{\partial }{\partial t}v'\\
    &=-\frac{g}{f}\frac{\partial h'}{\partial y}-
    \underbrace{\frac{1}{f}\frac{\partial }{\partial t} \biggl( \frac{g}{f}\frac{\partial h'}{\partial x}+\overbrace{\frac{1}{f}\frac{\partial u'}{\partial t}}^\text{small} \biggr)}_\text{small}
    \\
    &=-\frac{g}{f}\frac{\partial h'}{\partial y}
    -\underbrace{\frac{g}{f^2}\frac{\partial^2 h' }{\partial t \partial x}}_\text{small}
    -\underbrace{\frac{1}{f^2}\frac{\partial^2 u'}{\partial t^2}}_\text{doubly small}
\end{align*}

Fifth, we neglect the doubly small term (the third term) by approximating it as $0$.

Sixth, we use the $\beta$-plane approximation with the $f$ in the first term and the $f$-plane approximation with the $f^2$ in the second term. The justification for not using the $\beta$-plane approximation on both terms is as follows: the $\beta$-plane approximation is only valid if $y-y_0\ll a$, therefore the $\beta (y-y_0)$ term is much smaller than the $f_0$ term. We therefore neglect this term for the same reason why we neglected the $\frac{1}{f^2}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}$ term: it is doubly small. 

Repeating this for $v'$ allows us to derive the following relations for $u'$ and $v'$:

\begin{minipage}{.48\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        u'=-\frac{g}{f}\frac{\partial h'}{\partial y}-\frac{g}{f_0^2}\frac{\partial^2 h'}{\partial t \partial x}
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.48\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        v'=\frac{g}{f}\frac{\partial h'}{\partial x}-\frac{g}{f_0^2}\frac{\partial^2 h'}{\partial t \partial y}
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}

Now we plug in our expressions for $u'$ and $v'$ into Equation \ref{SW Lin mass} to derive the following equation governing $h$:
\begin{align*}
    0&=\frac{\partial h'}{\partial t}+H\left( \frac{\partial u'}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial v'}{\partial y} \right)=0
    \\
    &= \frac{\partial h'}{\partial t}+H\biggl( 
        \underbrace{-\frac{g}{f}\frac{\partial^2 h'}{\partial y \partial x}-\frac{g}{f_0^2}\frac{\partial^3 h'}{\partial t \partial x^2}}_{\frac{\partial u'}{\partial x}}
        +
        \underbrace{\frac{g}{f}\frac{\partial^2 h'}{\partial x\partial y}-\frac{g}{f_0^2}\frac{\partial^3 h'}{\partial t \partial y^2}
        -\frac{g}{f^2}\beta \frac{\partial h'}{\partial y}}_{\frac{\partial v'}{\partial x}}
     \biggr)
    \\
    &=L_d^2\left( \frac{1}{L_d^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\vec{\nabla}_h^2 + \beta \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)h'
\end{align*}
where $L_d=$ the \hyperref[SW Def Radius Box]{Rossby Deformation Scale}.

Again, we seek wave-like solutions, so we substitute in $h'=h_0 \exp\left( ikx+ily-i\omega t \right)$ to derive the \textbf{dispersion relation} governing the propagation of Rossby Waves:

    \label{Rossby Graph}
\end{figure}
\end{fact}

\subsection{Interpretation}

Note that we can no longer set $l=0$ without loss of generality, as the system is no longer isotropic. There is a difference between the $y-$direction and the $x-$direction: $f$ increases in the $y-$direction, but $f$ does not depend on the $x-$direction.

\subsubsection{The Phase and Group Velocities}

Again, let us calculate the phase and group velocites in the $x$-direction.
\begin{align*}
    [\vec{c}_p]_x = -\frac{\beta}{k^2+l^2+\frac{1}{L_d^2}}
    \\
    [\vec{c}_g]_x = \beta\left( \frac{k^2-l^2-\frac{1}{L_d^2}}{k^2+l^2+\frac{1}{L_d^2}} \right)
\end{align*}

Notice that the $x-$component (i.e., the zonal/east-west component) of the phase velocity $\vec{c}_p$ is always negative (since $\beta>0$ always). This implies that the phase velocity is always westwards, and so peaks and troughs \textit{always} travel westward. We will explain this later when we explain the mechanism for Rossby Wave propagation.

Let us now turn to the $x-$component of the group velcoity $\vec{c}_g$. The group velocity can be positive or negative depending on both the zonal and meridional wavelengths and their size relative to the Rossby Deformation Radius $L_d$. If $k$ is large relative to both $l$ and $1/L_d$ (i.e., the zonal wavelength is small relative to both the meridional wavelength and the Rossby Deformation Radius) then energy can propagate eastward. Conversely, if either $l$ or $1/L_d$ is large relative to $k$, then energy also propagates westward.

\subsubsection{Rossby Wave Propagation Mechanism}

Recall that \hyperref[PV]{Potential Vorticity} is \hyperref[Cons PV Box]{Materially Conserved} in the shallow water system. As such, any fluid parcel that is displaced by this anomaly/wave must have its potential vorticity remain constant.

Suppose that some phenomena generates an anomaly in $\vec{u}_h'$ such that a fluid parcel is pushed northwards (i.e., in the positive $y$-direction). If the fluid parcel is advected northwards, then the planetary vorticity $f$ increases. However, $(f+\xi)/h$ must be constant, and assuming that the change in $h$ is small, we require $\xi$ to decrease, which generates negative vorticity. The fluid parcels around this parcel are therefore forced accordingly: the parcels to the west are forced northward, and the parcels to the east are forced southward.

[FIGURE UNDER CONSTRUCTION]

Note that this explanation only works if the $Ro$ is not extremely small. However, in the ocean, $Ro$ is extremely small, and this implies that the relative vorticity is always much smaller than the planetary vorticity. Here is an alternative explanation for the ocean (courtesy of \href{https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/marshalld}{David Marshall}). In the ocean, since $Ro\ll 1$, the perturbations must be geostrophic. Therefore, $u$ is always geostrophic and the following obtains:
\begin{align*}
    u = - \frac{g}{f(y)}\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y}
\end{align*}

Suppose we have a bump in the ocean (i.e., a positive height anomaly). Since there is a height anomaly, there is also a pressure anomaly, the pressure is larger in the bump. Since the flow must be geostrophic, this implies that the fluid must be anti-cylonic and must be flowing clockwise in the northern hemisphere (recall our discussion on cyclones and anti-cyclones in Section \ref{Cyclones}).

However, recall that $u\sim 1/f$ because it is geostrophic, therefore at the north edge of the height anomaly, the $f$ is larger, therefore $u$ is smaller, and at the south edge of the height anomaly $f$ is smaller, therefore $u$ is larger. This implies that there is more fluid flowing westward than there is fluid flowing eastward, therefore there is a convergence of fluid westward and a divergence of fluid eastwards. This means that the hump travels westwards, thus explaining the westward propagation of Rossby Waves in the ocean.

\section{Kelvin Waves}

[KELVIN WAVES UNDER CONSTRUCTION]

For Rossby Waves, we assumed that the anomalies were to leading order geostrophic, which recall is a blance between the the corilis force and the pressure gradient force. There are at least two cases in which this assumption cannot hold.

The first case is along a boundary or a coastline.

The second case is along the equator, where $f\approx 0$, therefore $Ro \gg 1$. 

\subsection{Coastal Kelvin Waves}

\subsection{Equatorial Kelvin Waves}

\section{The Effects of Stratification: the Reduced Gravity System}

As mentioned in Section \ref{GFD Special}, the two important properties of GFD are rotation and stratification. We already consider the effects of rotation in the Shallow Water System by introducing the coriolis force (the $f\vec{k}\times\vec{u}_h$ term) into Equation \ref{SW mom}. However, we have not yet considered stratification.

Now we consider a twist on the shallow water system. Instead of considering one single layer of fluid, consider two layers of fluid. We will be modelling the motion of the fluid in the top layer with density $\rho=\rho_0$. We assume that this top layer is bounded from above by a fluid of negligible density, such that it is almost always flat. We assume further that this top layer is bounded from below by a fluid of density $\rho_1=\rho_0+\Delta \rho_0$ with no horizontal fluid motion (See Figure \ref{RG Fig}).

Analogous to how we derived the shallow water equations, we now derive the reduced gravity equations. We make the identical assumptions as before, but our treatment of the horizontal pressure gradients $\vec{\nabla}_h p$ must differ due to the different configuration.

As before, we assume that the system is approximately in hydrostatic balance. The pressure between $z=0$ and $z=-h$ must be given by the following:
\begin{align*}
    p(x,y,z,t)= -\rho_0 g z + p_s(x,y,t)
\end{align*}
Taking the horizontal gradient of this gives us the following:
\begin{align*}
    \vec{\nabla}_h p = \vec{\nabla}_h p_s
\end{align*}

Note importantly that, as opposed to our derivation of the shallow water equations, we can no longer neglect the $\vec{\nabla}_h p_s$ term, as this term is the leading order contribution to $\vec{\nabla}_h p$ – if we neglected this term, $\vec{\nabla}_h p=0$!

We now consider the pressure below $z=-h$, again found hydrostatically:
\begin{align*}
    p(x,y,z,t) = -\rho_1 g ( h(x,y,t) + z) + \rho_0 g h(x,y,t) + p_s(x,y,t)
\end{align*}
However, we have assumed that the horizontal velocity in this layer is $0$, which implies that horizontal pressure gradients within this layer must vanish, i.e., $\vec{\nabla}_h p(x,y,z<-h,t)=0$. This condition gives un an expression for $\vec{\nabla}_h p_s$, which in turn gives us an expression for$ \vec{\nabla}_h p$:
\begin{align*}
    0 = -\rho_1 g \vec{\nabla}_h h + \rho_0 g \vec{\nabla}_h h + \vec{\nabla}_h p_s
    \\
    \therefore - \vec{\nabla}_h p_s = - (\rho_1 - \rho_0)\vec{\nabla}_h h
\end{align*}

The mass conservation equation is derived identically to before. We thus derive the \textbf{Reduced Gravity Equations}:

\begin{minipage}{0.48\linewidth}
    \begin{gather}
        \label{RG mom}
        \BOX{\frac{D_h\vec{u}_h}{Dt}+f\vec{k}\times\vec{u}_h+g'\vec{\nabla}_h h=0}\\
        \label{RG mass}
        \BOX{\frac{\partial h}{\partial t}+\vec{\nabla}_h\cdot(h\vec{u}_h)=0}

\end{minipage}

Where $g'$ is the reduced gravity and is defined as follows:

\begin{fact}{The Reduced Gravity}{RG Box}\label{RG Box}
    We define the reduced gravity $g'$ as:
    \begin{align}
        \BOX{g'=\frac{\Delta \rho_0}{\rho}g}
    \end{align}
    where $g=$ is the acceleration due to the gravity; $\rho$ is the density of the layer; and $\Delta \rho = \rho_1-\rho_0$, where $\rho_0$ is the density of the layer under consideration and $\rho_1$ is the density of the underlying layer.

    The reduced gravity equations are exactly the same as the \hyperref[shallow box]{Shallow Water Equations} but with all instances of $g$ replaced with a $g'$.

    It is generally the case that $g'\ll g$. 
\end{fact}

Importantly, the reduced gravity system affects the \hyperref[SW Def Radius Box]{Rossby Deformation Radius}, now given by the following expression:
\begin{align*}
    L_d = \frac{\sqrt{g' H}}{f}
\end{align*}
Therefore, since generally $g'\ll g$, and $L_d\sim\sqrt{g'}$, then $L_d$ is much smaller than we anticipated before.

\section{Justifying the Shallow Water System}\label{SW Justification}

I strongly \textit{strongly} emphasise that this section is off-syllabus. However, I thought I'd write it here to make the section more complete. I follow the Vallis' derivation in his book \cite{Vallis}, where it can be found in chapter 3.

In these entire set of notes, we formulate and analyse models of the atmosphere and oceans. Of course, part of the accuracy relies on the accuracy of our analysis, but crucially part of the accuracy also relies on the accuracy of the models. The shallow water system would not be as interesting of a system (to us at least) if we did not have some evidence that the model was faithful and captured (some) dynamics of the atmosphere and oceans.


\chapter{Time-Dependent 3D Systems}\label{3D Systems}

In the previous chapter, we considered a time-dependent model of the atmosphere and oceans and analysed time-dependent responses. The key limitation of that system was that that system was $2$-dimensional: we only considered a shallow layer at a time. We accounted for this somewhat when we introduced the \hyperref[RG Box]{Reduced Gravity System}, which represented the effects of stratification insofar as $g$ was replaced by $g'$. 

Now we aim to represent time-dependent 3D responses of the atmospheres and oceans. We start with gravity waves, although I would prefer to call these 3D Poincaré waves, as I will argue that these are the 3D analogue to the \hyperref[2D Poincare]{2D Inertia Gravity/Poincaré Waves} we considered last chapter. After this, we move onto what will take up the bulk of the chapter: \hyperref[QG]{Quasi-Geostrophic Theory}

\section{Gravity Waves (3D Poincaré Waves)}

\subsection{The Boussinesq Approximation and Linearisation}

Before linearising the system, we first invoke the \textbf{Boussinesq Approximation}. The \textbf{Boussinesq Approximation} is an approximation on the density field $\rho$. We first split the density field into three components that obey the following relations:
\begin{align*}
    &\rho(\vec{r},t)=\rho_0 + \hat{\rho}(z) + \rho'(\vec{r},t)
    \\
    &\bar{\rho}(z)=\rho_0 + \hat{\rho}(z)
    \\
    &\rho_0,\bar{\rho} \gg \hat{\rho}(z),\rho'(\vec{r},t)
\end{align*}

If we multiply Equations \ref{Horizontal Approximate} (Horizontal Momentum) and \ref{Vertical Approximate} (Vertical Momentum) by $\rho$ and expand every instance of $\rho$ as above, we obtain the following equations:
\begin{align*}
    (\rho_0+\hat{\rho}+\rho'(\vec{r},t))\frac{D\vec{u}_h}{Dt}+(\rho_0+\hat{\rho}+\rho'(\vec{r},t))f\vec{k}\times\vec{u}_h + \vec{\nabla}_h p = 0
    \\
    (\rho_0+\hat{\rho}+\rho'(\vec{r},t))\frac{Dw}{Dt}
    +
    (\rho_0+\hat{\rho}+\rho'(\vec{r},t))g + \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}= 0
\end{align*}

Recalling that $\rho_0 \gg \hat{\rho}, \rho'$, but also recalling from our scale analysis in Section \ref{Scale Analysis} that $g$ is large, we neglect \textit{all} variations in $\rho$ in these equations other than when $\rho$ is multiplied by $g$. This gives us the Approximate Momentum Equations under the Boussinesq Approximation:
\begin{align}
    \label{H bous}
    \boxed{
        \rho_0\frac{D\vec{u}_h}{Dt}+\rho_0f\vec{k}\times\vec{u}_h + \vec{\nabla}_h p = 0
    }
    \\
    \label{V bous}
    \boxed{\frac{Dw}{Dt}
    +
    \frac{\rho(\vec{r},t)}{\rho_0}g + \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}= 0}
\end{align}
Take note that we can define a spatially/temporally varying analogue of the \hyperref[RG Box]{reduced gravity} (in the shallow water system) $g'=\frac{\rho(\vec{r},t)}{\rho_0}g$, which, by stipulation, is much smaller than $g$. Furthermore, note that we did \textit{not} need to assume that $\rho'\ll \hat{\rho}$ in deriving Equations \ref{H bous} and \ref{V bous}. However, we will now assume that $\rho'\ll \hat{\rho}$ when we linearise the equations.

We now, in analogy to how we derived the dispersion relation before, linearise the equations of motion. We linearise about a state of rest $\vec{u}=0$\footnote{Note now that $\vec{U}$ is the 3-dimensional velocity, not just the horizontal velocity.} and a continuous (given) stratification $\rho=\bar{\rho}(z)$ and pressure field $p=\bar{p}(z)$.

\begin{minipage}{0.48\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        \vec{u}_h = \vec{0}+\vec{u}_h'\\
        w = 0 + w'
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.48\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        p = \bar{p}(z)+p'\\
        \rho = \bar{\rho}(z) + \rho'
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}

We further assume that the system is approximately hydrostatic, therefore, the following applies:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{d\bar{p}}{dz}=-\bar{\rho}g
\end{align*}

Which equations are we linearising? We linearise Equations \ref{H bous} (Horizontal Momentum), \ref{V bous} (Vertical Momentum), and \ref{Energy Equation} (Energy Equation). We will also use Equation \ref{Incompressibility} (Incompressibility), but this equation does not need to be linearised. This will give us, in total, 5 equations.

Skipping over the details of linearisation, we derive the following linearised equations (Equation \ref{H bous} becomes \ref{H lin}, \ref{V bous} becomes \ref{V lin}, \ref{Incompressibility} is \ref{Incompressible GW}, and \ref{Energy Equation} becomes \ref{MC lin}\footnote{
    The details for this are a bit complicated. I'd honestly recommend ignoring this, but if you're interested I'd refer to Vallis' textbook \cite{Vallis}. You'll need to first refer to page 41 where he rewrites the energy equation (he calls it the `thermodynamic equation') in another form. Then skip to page 72 where he simplifies this equation using the Boussinesq approximation. Then finally he derives that $\frac{D\rho}{Dt}=0$ if there is no heating.
 }):

\begin{minipage}{0.48\linewidth}
    \begin{align}
        \label{H lin}
        \boxed{\rho_0\frac{\partial \vec{u}_h'}{\partial t}+\rho_0 f\vec{k}\times\vec{u}_h' +\vec{\nabla}_h p' =0}
        \\
        \label{V lin}
        \boxed{\rho_0 \frac{\partial w'}{\partial t} + \rho' g +\frac{\partial p'}{\partial z}=0}
    \end{align}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.48\linewidth}
    \begin{align}
        \label{Incompressible GW}
        \boxed{\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{u}=0}
        \\
        \label{MC lin}
        \boxed{\frac{\partial \rho'}{\partial t} + w \frac{\partial \bar{\rho}}{\partial z}=0}
    \end{align}
\end{minipage}

\vspace{2mm} We thus have five linear equations governing five variables: $u$, $v$, $w$, $\rho$, and $p$ (I'm being lazy and have dropped the primes (the $'$'s) for brevity). Note that $\bar{\rho}$ is a given background density field: you do not have to solve for this.

\subsection{Aside: Buoyancy Oscillations}

Let us first consider a state such that: $u=v=p=\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}=0$, in which case all equations other than Equations \ref{V lin} and \ref{Incompressible GW} are trivially satisfied. If we differentiate Equation \ref{V lin} with respect to $t$, we can substitute for $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}$ using equation \ref{MC lin} to obtain the following equation:
\begin{align}
    \BOX{\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2}+N^2 w = 0}
\end{align}
where $N = \sqrt{-\frac{g}{\rho_0}\frac{\partial \bar{\rho}}{\partial z}}=$ the Brunt-Väisälä frequency. If you recall the discussion in section INSERT REFERENCE TO CLOUDS HERE in clouds, we have rederived the buoyancy oscillations as well as the buoyancy frequency!

This solutions describes columns of air (since $\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}=0$) oscillating upwards and downwards with a frequency given by $N$. The restoring force is not simply the gravitational force, but the buoyancy force, which is weaker than gravity due to the buoyancy of the air in the background state.

\subsection{Derivation}

We now derive the dispersion relation for internal gravity waves. Tim derives the dispersion relation slightly different to how I personally prefer to derive it. As before, Tim's method is more general, but my method (in my humble opinion) is a bit easier to remember and churn out in an exam. I won't go through the details because they are straightforward. I encourage the reader to derive the equations themselves. The method is analogous to our derivation of the dispersion relation for \hyperref[2D Poincare]{Poincaré Waves}: we set each variable proportional to an exponential function as follows:

\begin{minipage}{0.48\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        \vec{u}_h = \vec{u}_0 \exp \left( ikx + ily + imz - i\omega t \right)
        \\
        w = w_0 \exp \left( ikx + ily + imz - i\omega t \right)
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.48\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        p = p_0 \exp \left( ikx + ily + imz - i\omega t \right)
        \\
        \rho = \rho_c \exp \left( ikx + ily + imz - i\omega t \right)
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}

\vspace{2mm} Next, we eliminate four out of the five coefficients (e.g., we eliminate the coefficients $\vec{u}_0$, $w_0$, and $p_0$, leaving everything written in terms of $\rho_c$, $k$, $m$, and $\omega$). Next, we claim that $\rho_c\neq 0$ since we wish to find non-trivial solutions, and thus derive a relation between $\omega$ to $k$ and $m$. It should be the following:
\begin{gather}
    \BOX{\omega^2 = \frac{N^2 \left( k^2 + l^2 \right) + f^2 m^2}{k^2 + l^2 + m^2}}
\end{gather}

\subsection{Interpretation}

We again assume the \hyperref[f plane box]{$f$-plane approximation} so that we can take the meridional wavelength $l$ to be infinite (i.e., set $l=0$) without loss of generality. This gives us the following dispersion relation:
\begin{align}
    \BOX{\omega^2 = \frac{N^2  k^2   + f^2 m^2}{k^2 + m^2}}
\end{align}

First take a look at a few limits. If $N=0$ (i.e., the density does not decrease or increase with height) or $k=0$ (i.e., the meridional wavelength is infinite), then the following equation reduces to inertial oscillations. This is for two different reasons. If $N=0$, there is no effect of gravity, because the buoyancy exactly cancels out the effect of gravity. Convsersely, if $k=0$, the wavefronts are 

Conversely, if $f=0$ or $m=0$, 

To interpret this dispersion relation, let us first take the hydrostatic limit. Note that this is a \textit{further} assumption we must make. While we have already assumed that the background state is hydrostatic, we have not assumed that the perturbations are hydrostatic yet. 

If we assume that the perturbations are hydrostatic, this implies that $k\ll m$. WHY?? [UNDER CONSTRUCTION]

\section{Quasi-Geostrophic Theory}\label{QG}



\subsection{Derivation}

\subsubsection{Assumptions}

We first assume that $Ro<1$, i.e., $Ro$ is small but not extremely small. Second, we assume density variations are small so we can use the Boussinesq approximation. Third, we assume that the background pressure and density fields are hydrostatic. Fourth, we use the \hyperref[beta plane box]{$\beta$-plane approximation}. (Fifth) We further assume that $\frac{\beta y}{f_0}\sim O(Ro)$.

Our strategy is to now decompose each field into a geostrophic and ageostrophic component:
\begin{align*}
    \vec{u} = \vec{u}_g + \vec{u}_{ag}
    \\
    p = \bar{p}(z) p_g + p_{ag}
    \\
    \rho = \bar{\rho}(z) \rho_g + \rho_{ag}
\end{align*}
such that
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \bar{p}}{\partial z} = -\bar{\rho}g
\end{align*}

We further assume that the ratio of the magnitude of the ageostrophic comoponents to the geostrophic components are of order $Ro$. For example:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\left|\vec{u}_{ag}\right|}{\left|\vec{u}_g\right|}\sim O (Ro)
\end{align*}

We aim to derive a simplified set of equations from Equations \ref{Horizontal Approximate}, \ref{Vertical Approximate}, \ref{Incompressibility}, and

        \end{gather}
    \end{minipage}

\end{fact}

\subsection{Interpretation}

Before interpreting all the equations, it's first important to note the \textit{practical} achievement of these equations. We have drastically reduced the amount of variables we need to solve for by writing all the fields of interest ($u_g$, $v_g$, $w_{ag}$, $p_g$, and $\rho_g$) in terms of a single scalar field which is the streamfunction $\psi(\vec{r},t)$. Furthermore, this streamfunction has a fully three-dimensional dependence, constituting our simple but fully 3D model of the atmosphere/ocean. 

Interpretation of Equation \ref{QGPV Cons} is straightforward and analogous to our interpretation of \hyperref[Cons PV Box]{Conservation of Potential Vorticity} for the \hyperref[Shallow Water System]{Shallow Water System}. I should note, though, that we should think of this equation as a linearised version, as we use the geostrophic material derivative, rather than the material derivative. Recall that we assume that the flow is to leading order geostrophic, so assuming that the advection is accurately characterised by just the geostrophic velocities is not a bad assumption.

Interpretation of \ref{QGPV} is also relatively straightforward. $q$ is our quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity, an approximation of the potential vorticity. The terms are as follows:
\begin{align*}
    q = \underbrace{f_0 + \beta y}_{f=\text{Planetary Vorticity}}
    +
    \overbrace{\vec{\nabla}_h^2 \psi}^{\xi=\text{Relative Vorticity}}
    +\underbrace{\frac{\partial }{\partial z}\left( \frac{f_0^2}{N^2} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z} \right)}_\text{Vortex Stretching/Squishing}
\end{align*}
The first two terms are identified straightforwardly. $f_0+\beta y$ is manifestly a first approximation of the planetary vorticty, and $\vec{\nabla}_h^2\psi$ is equal to the relative vorticity if one considers Equation \ref{Streamfct}. 

The third term is a bit less straightforward. First consider the form of \hyperref[Cons PV Box]{Conservation of Potential Vorticity} for the \hyperref[Shallow Water System]{Shallow Water System} and expand Equation \ref{SW Cons PV} as follows (after multiplying by $h$):
\begin{align*}
    0&=h\frac{D}{Dt}\left( \frac{f+\xi}{h} \right)
    \\
    &=
    \frac{D}{Dt}(f+\xi) + \boxed{-\frac{f+\xi}{h}\frac{D}{Dt}(h)}
\end{align*}
Writing in it this form separates the two components of potential vorticity. The first term expresses the change in the vorticity of a fluid parcel, while the second boxed term expresses the change in the thickness of the column. In, other words, the second term captures the vortex stretching/squishing effect of conservation of potential vorticity.

If we expand Equation \ref{QGPV Cons} analogously we get the following:
\begin{align*}
    0 &= \frac{D_g}{Dt}\left( f+\xi +  \frac{\partial }{\partial z}\left( \frac{f_0^2}{N^2} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z} \right)\right)
    \\
    &=\frac{D_g}{Dt}(f+\xi) + \boxed{f_0 \frac{D_g}{Dt}\left( \frac{\partial }{\partial z}\left( \frac{f_0}{N^2} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z} \right)\right)}
\end{align*}

We identify the boxed terms as analogous to each other: they both correspond to vortex stretching/squishing. Making this analogy allows us to interpret each component the third term more readily:
\begin{align*}
    (f+\xi)\frac{1}{h}\frac{D}{Dt}(h) & \longleftrightarrow
    f_0\frac{1}{\partial z}\left( -\frac{D_g}{Dt}\left( \frac{f_0}{N^2} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z}\right) \right)
    \\
    f+\xi & \longleftrightarrow f_0
    \\
    \frac{1}{h} & \longleftrightarrow \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
    \\
    \frac{D}{Dt}(h) & \longleftrightarrow -\frac{D_g}{Dt}\left( \frac{f_0}{N^2} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z}\right)=w_{ag}
\end{align*}

Much of this can be argued from dimensional grounds, and, of course, they must match up dimensionally. The $f_0$ corresponds to the $f+\xi$ term, and is a good first order approximation because we assumed that $Ro$ was small, and therefore that $\frac{\xi}{f}$ was small. The $\frac{1}{h}$ corresponds to the $\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$ [UNDER CONSTRUCTION IDK WHY LOL]

Finally, the The $\frac{D}{Dt}(h)$ corresponds to the $w_{ag}$. Recall that the interface height in the shallow water system is [ALSO UNDER CONSTRUCTION]

Equations \ref{p QGPV} and \ref{rho QGPV} have a straightforward interpretation as well. The former is simply the constraint imposed by geostrophy, and the latter is the constraint imposed by hydrostasy.


\section{Quasi-Geostrophic Rossby Waves}

\subsection{Derivation}

As before with the \hyperref[Shallow Water System]{Shallow Water System} we linearise the \hyperref[QGPV]{Quasi-Geostrophic Potential Vorticity Equation} about a background state. However, this time we assume that the background state is a constant zonal flow, i.e., we linearise about the state $\vec{u}_g=(0,U,0)$ with a constant background stratificaiton ($N=const$). In other words, we linearise about a streamfunction $\Psi$ such that:
\begin{align*}
    \psi = \Psi + \psi'

    \psi' \ll \Psi

    \Psi = -Uy

\section{Instabilities and Geostrophic Turbulence}

\chapter{Ocean Circulation}\label{Oceans}

Throughout GFD, we have formulated models that apply to both the oceans and the atmosphere, but mostly with a focus on the atmosphere. Geostrophic and hydrostatic balance are accurate diagnostic relations in the ocean, our analysis using the shallow water system of waves is applicable to the oceans, aas is our discussion on instability and turbulence.

Now we pay explicit attention to just the oceans, but, as before, concepts here may be applicable to the atmosphere. As already touched upon, the oceans, while similar to the atmosphere in the sense that it is a fluid on a planet and so is affected by gravity (and so stratification) and rotation (and so coriolis), differs from the atmosphere dynamically in a few key ways.

First, the oceans are externally forced differently to the atmosphere. Recall our discussion in Section \ref{Differential Heating} that differential heating from the sun drives motion in the atmosphere: the atmosphere and oceans must transport energy poleward to close the energy budget. While the oceans accomplish this as well, the oceans are also, crucially, forced externally via atmospheric winds.

Second, unlike the atmosphere, the ocean has walls. This leads to effects in which we must consider. We considered this while discussing coastal \ref{Kelvin} waves, for example, but we will consider this further when we incorporate effects like friction.

Third, the equation of state and typical sea-water conditions means that variations in density within the ocean are very small, and seawater is much denser than the atmosphere. This implies that, if we were to model the ocean using a reduced gravity model, $g'$ would be much smaller, and therefore $L_d$ is also shorter. If we were to model the ocean using a continuous stratification, $N$ would be smaller, which, again, implies that $L_d$ is shorter in the ocean.

Finally, $Ro$ is much smaller in the ocean than in the atmosphere. $f$ is comparable in both the atmospheres and oceans. Meanwhile, both $L$ and $U$ are smaller in the ocean. We can understand this somewhat as follows, but I emphasise that what I am about to say is by no means a \textit{sufficient} explanation\footnote{And to be honest I don't know a dynamically sound argument why $Ro$ is smaller in the oceans. I think, however, an argument might go like this. First, note the energy recieved by the oceans and the atmospheres in \qty{}{\watt\per\square\meter}}. We expect $L$ to be set by $L_d$, which recall depends on the stratification. Since $N$ is smaller in the ocean, $L$ is smaller in the ocean. Meanwhile, we expect $U$ to be set by the energy and momentum budgets. While the atmosphere is directly forced by differential heating and latent heat releases, we expect (?) this energy source to be larger than the wind-stress the atmosphere exerts on the oceans, so we expect $U$ to be larger in the atmosphere. I have only explained why both $L$ and $U$ are smaller in the ocean than in the atmospheres, but note crucially that I have not explained why $U$ is smaller by a larger amount than $L$, and \textit{this} is what is required to explain why $Ro$ is smaller in the ocean than in the atmosphere.

We'll be exploring some effects of external forcing \ref{Ekman Transport} and the small rossby number \ref{Sverdrup Balance}.

\section{Ekman Transport (Shallow Ocean Circulation)}\label{Ekman Transport}

We begin by considering the effect of external forcing due to friction. For the ocean, this will be due to the atmosphere blowing over the ocean, which exerts a shear stress on the surface of the ocean, forcing the ocean to move in the same direction as the air. A \textbf{stress} is a force per unit area across a boundary. In this case, this is the boundary between the atmosphere adn the ocean. A \textbf{shear} stress is 

Actually, phenomena we discuss here is applicable to the atmosphere as well: the ground exerts a shear stress on the atmosphere in the opposite direction that the atmosphere is flowing in!

Ekman transport is the transport due to the circulation of 

Assume $Ro\ll1$ so we can neglect the acceleration/advection term in Equation \ref{Horizontal Approximate} and that $\rho=\rho_0=const$:
\begin{align*}
    f\vec{k}\times\vec{u}_h+\frac{1}{\rho_0}\vec{\nabla}_h p = \vec{F}_b
\end{align*}

We now no longer neglect other forces, and reintroduce the horizontal stress force. We assume that the horizontal stresses vary the most vertically, which means that we can write $F_b$ to a good approximation as follows:
\begin{gather*}
    \vec{F_b} = \frac{1}{\rho_0}\frac{\partial \vec{\tau}}{\partial z}\\
    \vec{\tau}=\underbrace{\rho_0\nu\frac{\partial \vec{u}_h}{\partial z}}_{\text{viscous stress}}-
    \underbrace{\rho_0 \overline{\vec{u}_h'w'}}_{\text{turbulent eddy stress}}
\end{gather*}
where $\vec{\tau}$ is the horizontal stress vector\footnote{If you are familiar with fluid mechanics, you will notice that, in reality, the stress is actually a tensor. [FOOTNOTE UNDER CONSTRUCTION]}. The second term is a bit more complicated, but just think of it as the effect of turbulent momentum fluxes which produce an effective force on the fluid (and read this\footnote{
    The explanation of the $\rho_0 \overline{\vec{u}_h'w'}$ is as follows. First we perform a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_decomposition}{Reynolds Decomposition} by splitting the velocity into a (time, space, or other suitably defined) average (indicated by a bar) and a fluctuation indicated by a prime:
    \begin{align*}
        \vec{u}_h = \overline{\vec{u}_h}+\vec{u}_h'
        \\
        w = \overline{w}+w'
    \end{align*}
    where the fluctuations average out to $0$ (e.g., $\overline{w'}=0$).

    While the fluctuations by themselves might average out to $0$, there might be correlations that don't average out to $0$. The turbulent momentum flux is the average correlation between the horizontal velocity and the vertical velocity: if there are correlations, then this will result in momentum being advected downwards or upwards. 
    
    For example, if $\vec{u}_h'$ is more likely to be pointing eastward when $w'<0$, then this will result in eastward momentum preferentially being advected downwards by vertical velocity fluctuations, which causes an effective momentum flux.
} footnote if you want more). Ekman transport is therefore a three-way balance between coriolis, pressure gradient forces, and horizontal stress from friction.

We define the \textbf{Ekman Layer} as lying between $z=0$, where the surface of the ocean is, and $z=-H$, where $z=-H$ when $\vec{\tau}=\vec{0}$. This specifies where $z=-H$, but note that we do not necessarily need to solve for $H$.

\subsection{Ekman Spiral}



\subsection{Ekman Flux}

We had to make the highly dubious approximation of the turbulent eddy stress term by a single (constant) turbulent eddy viscosity, we do not have to make the same assumption here. We again decompose the velocity $\vec{u}_h$ into a geostrophic component and an ekman (ageostrophic) component:
\begin{align*}
    \vec{u}_h = \vec{u}_g + \vec{u}_{Ek}
\end{align*}
where, again, $\vec{u}_g$ is defined as in Equation \ref{Geostrophic Balance}.

This implies that $\vec{u}_{Ek}$ is given by the following expression:
\begin{align*}
    \vec{u}_{Ek} = - \frac{1}{\rho_0 f}\vec{k}\times\frac{\partial \vec{\tau}}{\partial z}
\end{align*}

We now integrate this expression from $z=-H$ to $z=0$, and note that we can remain completely ignorant of the precise expression for $\vec{\tau}$ and make use simply of our boundary conditions. We define $\vec{U}_{Ek}$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
    \vec{U}_{Ek}&\equiv
    \int_{z=-H}^{z=0}\vec{u}_{Ek}\, dz
    \\
    &=
    -\frac{1}{\rho_0 f}\vec{k}\times\int_{z=-H}^{z=0}\frac{\partial \vec{\tau}}{\partial z}\, dz
    \\
    &=
    -\frac{1}{\rho_0 f}\vec{k}\times\int_{\vec{\tau}=\vec{0}}^{\vec{\tau}=\vec{\tau}_s}\,d\vec{\tau}
\end{align*}
\begin{gather}
    \therefore\BOX{
        \vec{U}_{Ek}=-\frac{1}{\rho_0 f}\vec{k}\times\vec{\tau}_s
    }
\end{gather}

We therefore have an expression for the Ekman Flux $\vec{U}_{Ek}$: the column integrated fluid flux from wind-forcing. Note a key nuance that this flux is not a volume flux: the dimensions are not a volume per second, but an area per second. To find the volume flux, we would also need to integrate this expression horizontally perpendicular to $\vec{U}_{Ek}$. (E.g., if $\vec{U}_{Ek}$ is pointing northward, we would need to integrate this zonally, i.e., from west to east to find the volume flux.)

Physically, we have a very similar situation to \hyperref[Geostrophic Box]{Geostrophic Balance}, for $\vec{U}_{Ek}$, we have a total balance between the horizontal stress $\vec{\tau}$ and the coriolis force. To make this more clear, we can write an expression for $\vec{U}_{Ek}$ another way:
\begin{align*}
    f\vec{k}\times \vec{U}_{Ek} = \frac{1}{\rho_0}\vec{\tau}_s
\end{align*}
which looks very analogous to Equation \ref{Geo Bal}, which expresses geostrophic balance.

Note that, in the northern hemisphere, $\vec{U}_{Ek}$ points to the right of $\vec{\tau}_s$, and vice versal in the southern hemisphere.

We have so far considered the horizontal Ekman flux, but we now wish to consider the vertical Ekman flux. We again decompose the vertical velocity $w$ into a geostrophic component\footnote{Recall that $w_g=0$ only if $\rho$ and $f$ do not vary, and while $\rho=\rho_0=const$, we do not wish to make the $f$-plane approximation here!} and an Ekman (ageostrophic) component. 

We wish to find the Ekman vertical velocity at $z=-H$ which we write as $w_{Ek}$. To find $w_{Ek}$, we apply Equation \ref{Incompressibility}, and integrate this equation again from $z=-H$ to $z=0$, where we assume that $w=0$ at $z=0$\footnote{It suffices just to assume that $w(z=0)\ll w(z=-H)$, which makes sense when we recall that $w=0$ is set by the fluid interface, and the air-sea interface moves much slower than the the interface within th ocean (recall our derivation of the \hyperref[RG Box]{Reduced Gravity System})}.

We define $w_{Ek}$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
    w_{Ek}&\equiv
    w(z=-H)
    \\
    &= w(z=-H)-w(z=0)
    \\
    &=\int_{z=-H}^{z=0}\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}\,dz
    \\
    &=\int_{z=-H}^{z=0}\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{u} - \vec{\nabla}_h \cdot \vec{u}_{Ek}\,dz
    \\
    &=\vec{\nabla}_h \cdot\int_{z=-H}^{z=0}\vec{u}_{Ek}\,dz
    \\
    &=\vec{\nabla}_h \cdot \vec{U}_{Ek}
\end{align*}
\begin{gather}
    \therefore \BOX{
        w_{Ek}=\vec{k}\cdot \vec{\nabla} \times \left( \frac{1}{\rho_0 f}\vec{\tau}_s \right) = \left[
            \vec{\nabla} \times \left( \frac{1}{\rho_0 f}\vec{\tau}_s \right)
        \right]_z
    }
\end{gather}

In other words, the ekman upwelling is equal to the ($z$-component of the) vorticity of the $\frac{1}{\rho_0 f}\vec{\tau}_s$. This could come from $f$, or it could come from the surface wind-stress field $\vec{\tau}_s$. 

\section{Sverdrup Balance (Deep Ocean Circulation)}\label{Sverdrup Balance}

We now turn our focus to below the Ekman layer, i.e., to $z<-H$. 

\section{Box Models of the Meridional Overturning Circulation}\label{MOC}

In this section we aim to construct a simple box model of the \textbf{Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation} (AMOC). The AMOC is a complex overturning circulation, consisting of warm waters which flow from the Southern Ocean northward, before turning cold and salty, sinking in the North Atlantic, and flowing southward to complete the loop.

This is a somewhat oversimplified version of the \textbf{MOC}, but I sadly don't have the time nor energy to get into it at this point. 

Crucially, though, the water must sink in the North Atlantic, and this requires the water to be denser or at least as dense as the water below it. We must therefore consider the \textbf{equation of state} that governs the density of sea water.

The equation of state is horribly complicated, and there (to the best of my knowledge) is no theoretical way to derive it. Instead, we use an empirically found Gibbs function of seawater $G$ to calculate the equation of state. Recalling that $dG = -S\,dT + \rho\,dp+\dots$, you can see that $\rho=\partial G/\partial p$.

This, still, is too complicated for our purposes, so we simply linearise the equation of state and assume that water is incompressible (water is actually compressible).

\begin{gather}
    \rho=\rho_0(1-\alpha (T-T_0)+\beta(S-S_0))
\end{gather}
